# Aleph Architecture Plan — The Agentic Research Method

> with the harness-neutral Core and host-adapter boundary fixed by
> [Decision 0004](../decisions/0004-core-adapter-and-bundle-boundary.md).**
> This tree remains subordinate to accepted doctrine and does not freeze a

## What this is

Aleph's accepted doctrine defines *what* must be true of a Research Précis
(completeness by disposition, compactness by normalization, projection
neutrality, per-cluster routing, derivation-trail reconstructability) and *what*
the repo owns (distillation, the Précis artifact, a separate projection stage).
What it does not yet define is the **full system that executes the method at
scale** — the agentic research method: how a capable host adapter (or a human,
by hand) takes a messy corpus and drives it through distillation, verification,
and projection with every invariant held, every step checkpointed, and every
claim of capability backed by replay evidence.

This plan defines that system end to end: the architecture, the artifact
contracts, the pipeline with per-stage definitions of done, the agent
orchestration invariants plus one Fable reference profile, the verification
stack, the projection stage, operating manuals for agent mode and manual mode,
and a slice-by-slice build roadmap. Core owns the invariants and evidence;
adapters own host mechanics and profiles. The host-neutral execution floor is
the
[`runner capability contract`](../../adapter-protocol/runner-capability-contract.md).

## Build kits (the with-what)

Three subdirectories turn the plan into hand-off material a builder can
execute without design decisions left open:

| Kit | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| [`templates/`](templates/README.md) | Copy-into-a-run templates for every artifact: exact table shapes, filling rules, micro-examples, Précis rendering rules |
| [`prompts/`](prompts/README.md) | The accepted-for-supervised-use prompt pack: assembly rules, common preamble, orchestrator prompt, all worker roles with bundles/withholds and output contracts, all verifier lens charters with quorum defaults |
| [`checker-spec/`](checker-spec/README.md) | Implementation specs for kernel increments K1–K6: per-check rules, exact FAIL formats, false-positive guards, negative-battery case lists |

**If you are the builder — any implementing agent or human — start at
[`13-build-handoff.md`](13-build-handoff.md).**

A reader who wants the shortest path to understanding: read 1, 2, 4, then the
runbook for your mode (8 or 9), then the slice you are building in 10,
consulting 3, 5, 6, 7 as the slice demands.

```

Manual mode executes Core directly through human worksheets and sparse
derivation cards. Future agent mode executes the same byte-identical Core
through a protocol-conforming host adapter. Repo-consumption mode ingests the
artifacts. The difference between modes and hosts is who runs the steps and how
densely the bookkeeping is materialized — never the doctrine, stage contracts,
authority gates, or what must be true at the end.

## Boundaries and implementation status

- Not a doctrine amendment. The wedge, disposition contract, and ADRs remain
  load-bearing; fixture-backed K1-K6 checks implement their structural
  boundaries without taking over semantic judgment.
- The initial substrate implementation now lives in the golden fixtures,
  projection packages, front door, and dependency-free K1-K6 scripts.
  Implementation does not freeze the provisional Markdown shapes.
- `core.manifest.json` classifies the exact source inventory. Immutable
  `aleph-for-loa` and `aleph-for-hermes` bundles must contain byte-identical
  complete Core trees plus only their selected adapter. Core equality and
  foreign adapter-owned payload/dependency exclusion are release-blocking.
- The Loa adapter now provides a structurally implemented native entrypoint and
  offline installation; it has no accepted replay, validation, or sanction.
  The other registered adapter remains planned, and manual-only sanction is
  unchanged.
- This plan is not capability evidence. Agent mode, real-output quality,
  mode equivalence, convergent-heavy routing, and v1 remain gated by the
  replays, audits, and authority decisions named here.
- It is not permission for an endpoint, autonomous truth engine, extractor,
  crawler, or unattended acceptance path. The do-not-build list remains
  binding.
