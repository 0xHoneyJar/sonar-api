# Loa Aleph

> Loa Aleph is a research handoff substrate for agent systems: it compresses
> fragmented research, conversation history, citations, design notes, and
> unresolved claims / questions into portable context packets — Research Précis for repos
> to ingest.

Start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) to run the method manually, conduct a
supervised agent evaluation, author a projection, extend the substrate, or
consume an accepted artifact.

## What Aleph is

Aleph is a **process substrate**. It turns a messy, bounded body of research —
raw conversations, deep-research output, citations, design notes, and unresolved
claims / questions — into a single **portable Research Précis file** that any downstream
repo or substrate can ingest.

The Research Précis is the artifact at the hinge of the process: it sits at the
**end of distillation** and at the **start of every downstream build**.

## What a Research Précis is

A Research Précis is a **complete-but-compact, projection-neutral** intermediate
representation. Its final form is deliberately deferred — it is a placeholder
that a separate projection stage (Aleph's own or a consumer's) renders into
whatever is needed.

The same Précis can become a PRD, a substrate, a control plane, a business
process, an experience, a landscape, or a product spec. These are **projections**
— purpose-specific renderings of one canonical Précis. There is one canonical
Précis; the renderings are many. Projection happens in a **separate downstream
stage** (owned by Aleph, see below) or by an external consumer; either way it is
distinct from the Précis, which never renders itself.

A Précis is characterized by three properties:

- **Complete by disposition coverage** — every candidate claim extracted from the
  declared corpus scope has a recorded disposition. Nothing load-bearing that
  entered the extraction pass silently vanishes.
- **Compact by normalization** — every claim appears once, carrying its
  provenance and status. Redundancy is stripped. Duplicate conviction is not
  allowed to masquerade as new evidence.
- **Neutral because final-form projection is deferred** — the Précis does not
  decide what it will become. A separate projection stage does — whether Aleph's
  own (see "Where Aleph sits in the stack") or a consuming repo's.

A Précis is therefore **not a loose summary** and **not a transcript**. It is
compact by normalization and complete only across the declared candidate-claim
disposition inventory: every candidate claim admitted into the extraction pass
must be carried, merged, deferred, excluded-with-reason, backgrounded,
judged-non-load-bearing, or unresolved.

## File-first, not endpoint

The Research Précis is a **portable file artifact** — something that can be
checked in, handed off, diffed, versioned, audited, and consumed by a repo.

Endpoint or integration surfaces may come later, but they **project from** the
artifact; they are not the artifact.

```
Précis  = canonical portable artifact
endpoint = optional later projection / delivery surface
```

## Where Aleph sits in the stack

Aleph is upstream of the products that consume its output. It is a separate
concern from the business-intelligence layer and from any product surface.

```

market-intel    product/        future consumers
consumers       platform use
(may also project the neutral Précis themselves)
```

An adjacent business / market-intelligence consumer or projection layer is
optional, not a mandatory intermediary between Aleph and Freeside. The Précis
fans out to whichever consumers need it; no single downstream sits on the path
of any other.

- **Aleph** — research handoff / distillation substrate. Produces portable
  Research Précis files for repos to ingest.
- **Business / market-intelligence consumer** — a future, optional, stack-wide
  downstream role. It is outside Aleph, is not Freeside-specific, and may
  project the neutral Précis under its own contract.
- **Freeside** — product / platform surface (token gating, teams, growth loops).
  The first concrete consumer context for current research, not the boundary of
  anything upstream.

## Status

**Local substrate implementation candidate.** The repository now contains the
manual and supervised-agent runbooks, full artifact templates, prompt pack, a
complete golden manual-run fixture, evidence/routing/projection fixtures,
product-doctrine and software-PRD projection packages, and dependency-free
K1-K6 deterministic checks. The fixture suite exercises the full path from
frozen source spans through a neutral Précis and into both rendered projection
types.

This is not a v1 declaration. Agent mode has not completed an accepted real
corpus run; manual-to-agent reconstruction and mode equivalence have not been
demonstrated; convergent-heavy and known-category-plus-novel-delta routing
remain unvalidated; and no real Tier-1 or Tier-2 output has received independent
audit and authority acceptance. Fixture-simulated sign-offs prove record shapes,
not governance or output quality.

Run the deterministic suite from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

All authored executable source is strict TypeScript. Node 22.18 or newer
executes the `.ts` entrypoints directly. The tracked JavaScript under
`runtime-js/` is deterministic ES2022 compiler output retained only for the
dependency-free Node 20 release runtime, and `.gitattributes` excludes that
generated tree from authored-language statistics. The npm test sequence runs
`tsc --noEmit`, rejects JavaScript outside that generated tree, and verifies
the committed projection byte-for-byte before the deterministic fixture and
mutation checks.

No endpoint is part of this product, and there is no final schema freeze beyond
the accepted provisional v0 envelope.

**Projection is a separate downstream stage.** The Précis itself stays strictly
projection-neutral and never generates a finished document. Aleph additionally
owns a distinct **projection stage** that *consumes* a finished Précis and
*renders* it into consumer documents (product-doctrine, architecture/primitive
map, responsibility/environment-verification map, mvp-wedge; and domain-specific
terminal renderings such as a PRD or SSD). Neutrality is a property of the
Précis, not of the repo. See `docs/decisions/0001-projection-as-separate-downstream-stage.md`.
