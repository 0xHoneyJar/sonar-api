# Session Notes

## ⏳ ACTIVE SPIKE — self-host Envio+HyperSync measure (cost-read due 2026-06-22 · `bd-fj1n.4`)
> Running DARK on Railway project `devoted-happiness`/`5972976f`, service `sonar-api`/`920a3274`, deploy
> `e92ec5e3` (`ENVIO_RESTART=0`, `NODE_OPTIONS=12288`). Does NOT touch green / consumers / `BELT_UPSTREAM`.
> **TOIL VERDICT (in, 2026-06-20):** 0 sync incidents — rode clean through Arbitrum(~475M)+Zora(~47M), the
> KF-015 Ponder-OOM regions, ~40 min to head, 0 OOM. HyperSync-on-all-chains killed the toil that flipped
> the original TCO to managed. **COST (pending):** let run ~48h → read MEASURED Railway $/mo + HyperSync
> sub → `bd-fj1n.4` crossover vs managed-Envio (toil≈0 both sides, so it's pure $). Fixes in
> `feat/envio-321-port` (ahead 2 of origin, durable in main `.git`): `3cc18c6b` (Dockerfile.belt build),
> `16f0433c` (events-publisher flood). Spec: `grimoires/loa/specs/2026-06-20-spike-self-host-envio-hypersync-measure.md`.
> SVM-substrate research in flight (is self-host-Envio chain-agnostic EVM+SVM, or EVM-only — the real
> scalability question). Session-cron `4c2222c9` set but session-only; THIS note + `bd-fj1n.4` are the durable reminder.

## Session Continuity — green-build LIVE state (2026-05-22 session 4)

**Green = the 6-chain consolidated belt (config.yaml), standing up NOW in freeside-sonar/production (blue-green-as-services).**

> **✅ UPDATE (2026-05-22, later session 4):** seed verified (COUNT==6) → resumed (`ENVIO_RESTART=0`) → all 6 chains backfilling. Hit **KF-015 (Node JS-heap OOM)**: 6-chain load OOM'd Node's ~2GB default heap in the 24GB container → Arbitrum+Zora froze (crash-loop on dense mint regions) while others advanced. **FIXED:** `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288` on belt-indexer-green → Zora converged to head, Arbitrum unstuck (+58.5M). All 6 now healthy; Base (8453) + Arbitrum (42161, 296M-block span) are the multi-hour long poles → overnight to converge. **NODE_OPTIONS must persist on green post-swap (KF-015).** Pending items 1-2 below are DONE; remaining = belt-hasura-green, gate expansion-mode (bd-umw.6)+Part-4 (bd-umw.7), certify, swap.
>
> **✅✅ CONVERGED (2026-05-22):** all 6 chains AT HEAD, remaining=0 (~14.7M events: Base 8.57M · Berachain 5.53M · ETH 351k · OP 197k · Arbitrum 29k · Zora 24k). Green cold-sync DONE. Next: stand up belt-hasura-green → gate expansion-mode + Part-4 → certify → swap. Local dashboard: `node scripts/sync-dashboard.cjs` (localhost:8787).
> **Score raw-data direction → RFC `0xHoneyJar/score-api#163`** (watermark ETL belt-PG→score-PG over GraphQL; BRIN+MV not ClickHouse; DuckDB escape hatch). **S3 swap dependency:** `promote.sh` must publish a stable "current-belt DATABASE_URL" (metadata signal) alongside the BELT_UPSTREAM GraphQL flip, so Score (raw-PG consumer) knows which belt is live. Stale Score memories corrected 2026-05-22 (feedback_score_not_api / reference_score_sonar_pipeline).

### Session 5 progress (2026-05-22) — hasura-green UP + gate expansion-mode/Part-4 SHIPPED
- **✅ `belt-hasura-green` stood up** (`hasura/graphql-engine:v2.43.0`, mirrors blue exactly + `NO_OF_RETRIES=10`) → `${{Postgres-vRR1.*}}` (GREEN; wipe-blue guard held). Temp public domain `https://belt-hasura-green-production.up.railway.app` (REMOVE post-certify). Admin secret → `~/.railway-belt-hasura-green-secret` (mode 600). **94 tables tracked + 94 public select-perms** (bulk metadata API — replicated blue's exact 94 = 93 entities + `chain_metadata`; green/blue share an IDENTICAL 93-entity schema, differ only in row counts). Green serves all 6 chains over anon `public` GraphQL. **Did NOT set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` on belt-indexer-green** (only used for auto-track-on-fresh-init, done manually; avoids restarting the healthy synced indexer) — optional post-swap hygiene.
- **✅ `bd-umw.6` (gate EXPANSION-mode) + `bd-umw.7` (Part-4 raw-L1 + `makeFetchSnapshot` live) — CLOSED.** `/implement` test-first; **42/42 tests** (18 parity preserved + 24 new). `runGate(blue,green,{mode:'parity'|'expansion'})`; expansion = shared `green ≥ blue−floor` (non-lossy, green MAY exceed), new entities/chains → Part-4. Part-4 = raw `eth_getLogs` bypassing eRPC (dedicated per-chain RPC, SR-4 backoff+jitter, SR-5 golden+`requiredChains` fail-closed; empty-200 = GAP per KF-012). Report: `a2a/sprint-174/reviewer.md`.
- **🔎 LIVE-SMOKE FINDING (read-only `makeFetchSnapshot`):** the stale `MintActivity 10,000` baseline misled — **live blue == live green** on Mibera entities (MintActivity 29,514 · MiberaTransfer 39,715 · MiberaLoan 176) because Mibera isn't on Arb/Zora. The real expansion delta is **`Action` blue 2,071,824 → green 2,391,346 (+319,522)** from new-chain activity. Gate uses LIVE blue counts in the compare (the `baseline` field is doc-only), so this is correct → green ≥ blue non-lossy holds.
- **✅ CERTIFY PASS (2026-05-22, expansion mode)** — `a2a/sprint-174/promotion-reconciliation.md`. Part 1 ✅ (shared chains green≥blue; Arb/Zora deferred), Part 2 ✅ (all 12 footprint non-lossy), Part 3 ✅ (schema superset), Part 4 ✅ (golden samples grounded in L1: Arb HoneyJar2 `0x1b27…1b72` @103234426=1 / @459381960=5 logs · Zora HoneyJar3 `0xe798…9fb0` @18090868=2 / @43801311=1 logs). Green non-lossy + new-chains-verified → **swap allowed** (exit 0). Golden samples saved in the gate run env; new chains carry HoneyJar only (Transfer 29,250 Arb / 24,422 Zora; Action=0 on both — the +319k Action delta is green's EXTRA shared-chain contracts, 41 vs blue's 16).
- **✅ REVIEW (2026-05-22) — All good (with noted concerns).** Cross-model dissent (codex-headless) caught **2 BLOCKING fail-closed gaps**, both fixed + tested + proven live: **(1)** `requiredChains` was circular (derived from green's own chainMeta → a silently-dropped new chain was invisible) → now an INDEPENDENT `EXPECTED_CHAINS` completeness list (fail-closed if unset); **(2)** Part-4 only checked log non-emptiness → now golden-tx identity match (`expectTx`). Unit suite **50/50** (was 42). **Hardened re-certify PASS** (`EXPECTED_CHAINS=[1,10,8453,42161,80094,7777777]` + 4 identity golden samples; live negatives confirm exit 1 when EXPECTED_CHAINS unset or golden tx absent). Feedback trail: `a2a/sprint-174/{engineer-feedback,reviewer}.md`. **Certify command (reuse for pre-swap re-check):** the env block with `PROMOTION_MODE=expansion` + `EXPECTED_CHAINS` + `GOLDEN_SAMPLES` (golden tx pairs: Arb HoneyJar2 `0x1b27…1b72` @103234426 tx `0xa6cb…3a57` / @169453177 tx `0x8725…441e`; Zora HoneyJar3 `0xe798…9fb0` @18090868 tx `0x16f6…f807` / @18117647 tx `0x770b…e1c7`).
- **✅ AUDIT (2026-05-22) — APPROVED.** Paranoid Cypherpunk audit; **KF-004 suspicion lens recovered 1 HIGH** that the validator schema-rejected: GraphQL URLs were written to the git-committed report + thrown errors (credential-leak vector if a credentialed/keyed URL is configured) → fixed via `redactUrl()` (strips userinfo + token/key/secret/admin/sig query params), 4 tests. No hardcoded secrets, fail-closed throughout, zero-dep. Unit **54/54**. `a2a/sprint-174/{auditor-sprint-feedback.md,COMPLETED}`. bd-umw.6/.7 labeled review-approved + security-approved.
- **✅ SWAP MACHINERY BUILT (2026-05-22, bd-c09.1 + bd-c09.4 CLOSED — code-complete, NOT deployed).** **`Caddyfile`:** `admin off` → `admin localhost:2019` (Option B §7.4, loopback-only; off-host-verify = bd-c09.2 operator-paced; Option C ≥2-replicas contingency). Dockerfile.gateway unchanged (Caddyfile COPY'd). **`scripts/promote.sh`** (the ONLY swap path, R-D): runs promotion-gate.js as NON-SKIPPABLE precondition (`run_gate || exit 1`, fail-closed), sole BELT_UPSTREAM writer (→ green `belt-hasura-green.railway.internal:8080`), publishes `CURRENT_BELT_DATABASE_URL` Score #163 signal (configurable via SCORE_SIGNAL_SERVICE/VAR), `--rollback` (no gate, → blue `belt-hasura.railway.internal:8080`, R-A), `--dry-run`, §8 triggers in header+footer. **`test/promote.bats` 6/6** + **live dry-run PASS** (real gate EXPANSION PASS → intended green flip printed, 0 writes). Report `a2a/sprint-175/reviewer.md`.
- **✅✅ SWAP LIVE — G1 ZERO-DOWNTIME ACHIEVED (2026-05-22 ~16:43).** Ran `scripts/promote.sh` for real (gate re-ran as precondition → PASS → set `BELT_UPSTREAM`=green `belt-hasura-green.railway.internal:8080`). **Probe: 182 polls, ALL 200, ZERO 5xx**; clean cutover between consecutive 0.5s polls (`16:43:15 chains=4` blue → `16:43:16 chains=6` green). **Did NOT need healthcheck/replicas** — Railway's deploy overlap + fast Caddy gave seamless zero-downtime at 1 replica (the §7.4 Option-B Caddyfile admin change is committed but UNUSED — `caddy reload` isn't externally triggerable on Railway; the practical mechanism = var-flip + Railway's overlapping redeploy). **Green now serves the consumer alias** `belt-gateway-production.up.railway.app` with all 6 chains (G3: 0 consumer config changes). `railway scale` CLI is BROKEN (panics on `railwayMetal` schema drift) — replicas not CLI-settable; healthcheck has no CLI command (dashboard/IaC only) — neither needed.
- **⚠️ Score #163 signal — SECURITY: removed (do NOT default-publish resolved creds on the proxy).** promote.sh's `CURRENT_BELT_DATABASE_URL='${{Postgres-vRR1.DATABASE_URL}}'` **resolved to the green DB's plaintext creds** on belt-gateway (a Caddy proxy that doesn't need DB creds) AND got printed to the session transcript. **Deleted it from belt-gateway.** **Green DB password MUST be rotated** (it's in this session log). **#163 follow-up:** the signal needs a proper mechanism — set a Railway *reference* on the **score-api** side (resolves in Score's env, which needs creds anyway), NOT a resolved URL on the gateway; cross-project setting isn't reachable from `~/.railway-green.tok` regardless. **promote.sh code follow-up:** stop default-publishing the signal to the gateway (make it opt-in / score-side) until #163 lands.
- **✅ ROLLBACK EXERCISE COMPLETE (2026-05-22, bd-c09.3 CLOSED) — full safety net PROVEN, all zero-downtime:** swap blue→green (182 polls, 0 5xx) · rollback green→blue (`promote.sh --rollback`, no gate, 96 polls, 0 5xx) · re-promote blue→green (gate PASS, 161 polls, 0 5xx). **G1 + G3 + G4 + R-A all proven.** Final state: `BELT_UPSTREAM`=green, gateway clean (signal cred deleted). **Clarification:** the live gateway STILL runs `admin off` — my `Caddyfile admin localhost:2019` change is **local/uncommitted/un-uploaded**, so the var-flip redeploys reused the last-built image; zero-downtime came purely from **Railway's deploy-overlap + fast Caddy**, NOT caddy-reload. bd-c09.2 (off-host admin verify) is N/A until the Caddyfile admin change is actually deployed (`railway up -s belt-gateway`) — deferred. **Caddyfile admin change kept** (SDD §7.4 Option-B decision, localhost-only safe, future reload use) but currently unused.
- **NEXT (operator-paced, soak-gated):** **SOAK** — green serving, blue kept HOT + at-head; watch §8 triggers through the rollback window. Then after the window clean: **retire blue** (irreversible — delete belt-indexer + belt-hasura + Postgres-3vIC) → S4 (bd-kgx.*: FR-1 one-belt note, FR-9 score-api boundary, FR-10 reserve, E2E G1-G4 evidence → a2a/sprint-176/e2e-validation.md) → `/run-bridge 3` over the shipped diff (expect KF-014). **Cleanup:** remove temp green-hasura public domain; **ROTATE green DB password (in this transcript) + belt-hasura-green admin secret**; REVOKE `~/.railway-green.tok`. **promote.sh code follow-up:** stop default-publishing the Score signal to the gateway (cred over-exposure) — make it opt-in / score-side per #163.

- **Services created (Railway, freeside-sonar/production):**
  - `Postgres-vRR1` — green's isolated DB (Railway auto-named; the `-s Postgres-green` flag is ignored for DB services). Empty / seeding.
  - `belt-indexer-green` — config.yaml (6-chain), `ENVIO_RESTART=1` seed deploy IN PROGRESS via `railway up` (local dir; **no push, blue untouched**).
- **🔒 Isolation VERIFIED before any `--restart`:** `belt-indexer-green` `ENVIO_PG_HOST=postgres-vrr1.railway.internal` (GREEN), NOT blue's `postgres-3vic.railway.internal`. Wipe-blue guard = every `ENVIO_PG_*` is a `${{Postgres-vRR1.*}}` reference. `ENVIO_API_TOKEN=${{belt-indexer.ENVIO_API_TOKEN}}` (HyperSync for Berachain, no secret copy). `ENVIO_PG_SSL_MODE=false` (KF-013). No `HASURA_*` yet (not needed to seed/sync).
- **Token:** project token at `~/.railway-green.tok` (mode 600, used as `RAILWAY_TOKEN=$(cat …)` so it never hits command logs). **REVOKE in Railway after the cycle** (operator token-hygiene).
- **PENDING (resume here):**
  1. Verify seed `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chain_metadata == 6` (BB-F006 gate; expect the KF-013 28P01 crash AFTER seeding — that's success, not failure).
  2. Remove the `ENVIO_RESTART` var on belt-indexer-green → redeploy → **resume** → cold-sync (HOURS; Base/ETH dense regions throttle per KF-012).
  3. Create `belt-hasura-green` (hasura/graphql-engine image → `${{Postgres-vRR1.*}}`) during the sync; then set belt-indexer-green `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` → green hasura.
  4. Build gate **expansion-mode** (`bd-umw.6`) + Part-4 raw-L1 ground-truth (`bd-umw.7`) — green ⊋ blue, so non-lossy not parity; new chains (Arbitrum/Zora) certified ONLY by raw-L1.
  5. Certify green (enhanced gate) → swap `BELT_UPSTREAM` blue→green (S3) → rollback test → delete old blue.

## Decision Log — sonar-belt-factory SDD (2026-05-21, /architect)
- **[SCOPE — S2 = consolidation EXPANSION, not a parity dry-run] (2026-05-22, operator decision, session 4).** Operator chose green = the **6-chain consolidated belt** (`config.yaml`: + Arbitrum 42161 + Zora 7777777, 41 contracts) over a parity dry-run of the live 4-chain mibera belt (`config.mibera.yaml`). Rationale (verbatim): *"setup green AND also expand to full coverage … perfect time … go for 2"* — the green-build IS the consolidation. **Branch-reality that triggered the fork:** blue (live, `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=Dockerfile.belt`) runs `config.mibera.yaml` = 4 chains (1/10/8453/80094), NOT the 6-chain `config.yaml` the plan's exec-summary implies; the gate FOOTPRINT baselines match the mibera belt. **IMPLICATIONS:** (1) the promotion is an **EXPANSION** (green ⊋ blue) → `promotion-gate.js` needs an **expansion-mode** (green **≥** blue NON-LOSSY for shared entities/chains, NOT `|green−blue|≤tol` parity); the 18 parity tests stay (degenerate dry-run case). (2) The 2 new chains have **NO blue baseline** → raw-L1 `eth_getLogs` **ground-truth (the S1-deferred Part-4) becomes LOAD-BEARING** as the only correctness check for Arbitrum/Zora coverage (SR-4 backoff + dedicated key, SR-5 golden IDs). (3) `Dockerfile.belt` config-parameterized via `BELT_CONFIG` build-arg (default `config.mibera.yaml` so **blue build is unchanged**; green sets `config.yaml`). Tracked: **bd-umw.7** (gate expansion-mode), **bd-umw.8** (Part-4 live ground-truth), **bd-umw.9** (Dockerfile param). SDD §6 gate semantics to be amended parity→expansion. Green Postgres-green is structurally isolated (FR-3) — the wipe-blue guard: green's `ENVIO_PG_*` MUST reference Postgres-green, never Postgres-3vIC.
- **[ACCEPTED-DEFERRED → S2] S1 live-data ACs (2026-05-22, /implement sprint-1).** Three S1 ACs need a live green deployment + live L1 RPC that S2 builds, so their LIVE exercise is deferred to S2's dry-run promotion; S1 ships the gate LOGIC (tested) + the per-MODE classification (Task 1.0): (1) **fixed-block-cutoff fetch** (FR-4/R-F) — the per-MODE at-block count queries (`target = min(blue,green)−margin`) run against live blue+green in S2; S1 encodes the modes in `FOOTPRINT` + the comparison in `checkEntityCounts` (tested). (2) **raw-L1 `eth_getLogs` spot-check** (R-B/SR-4) — needs live RPC + dedicated key; wired in `main()` design, exercised S2. (3) **golden-id content sample** (R-E/SR-5) — needs live rows; exercised S2. Rationale: green does not exist in S1; the gate's pure logic is fully unit-tested (15/15) and the live wiring feeds the same functions in S2. The S1 self-parity + injected-failure ACs are MET via the test harness.
- SDD written to `grimoires/loa/sdd.md` for cycle `sonar-belt-factory` — N-belt generalization of the single-belt r4 SDD.
- **FR-1 partition resolved**: 41 contracts → 9 belts (honeyjar, mibera, sf-vaults, apdao, berachain-core, aquabera, crayons, purupuru, paddle). PaddleFi+CandiesMarket1155+GeneralMints get a `paddle` (DeFi/lending) home; FriendtechShares→`friendtech` OR fold to paddle; CubBadges1155→honeyjar (Cub ecosystem); TrackedErc20→berachain-core (utility, indexed once); TrackedErc721→split by chain home (apdao seat on Bera; lore on OP→mibera). MiladyCollection→mibera. Final count is FR-0-gated (cost may consolidate).
- **Shipped "mibera belt" is actually the score-api-footprint ECOSYSTEM belt** (16 contracts, 4 chains) — re-scoping it to pure-product is R7's hazard; preserve score-api#151 footprint via federation overlay.
- **KF-013 re-init pattern** (set ENVIO_RESTART=1 → deploy seeds+crashes → delete var → redeploy resumes) is load-bearing for FR-0 multi-deployment + FR-2 per-belt deploy. Belt runs without persisted_state (resume reads chain_metadata/checkpoints).
- **FR-0 D6 closure**: KF-013 establishes that config-mutation reset is per-deployment; multi-deployment = separate Railway service + separate Postgres + ENVIO_RESTART-gated init per belt. eRPC L2 stays SHARED (cache compounds).
- BeaconV3 schema read (`loa-freeside/packages/beacon-schema/src/beacon-v3.ts` v0.2.0): V2 base (mcp/cli/pricing/publisher/auth) + 6 V3 fields (is/is_not≥2/composes_with/acvp_invariants/sealed_schemas/cycle_state). is_not entries MUST start "Does NOT"/"Will NOT"/"Refuses to". Tag refs = TagName@semver+hash8-16.
- Effect FR-5: domain/ports/live/mock + single ManagedRuntime.make (grep gate =1) at NEW serving layer only; Envio handlers stay, become live adapters. suffix-as-type (*.port.ts/*.live.ts/*.mock.ts).

## Current Focus
- **SESSION 3 (2026-05-21) — Berachain ECOSYSTEM belt DEPLOYED + backfilled + validated (leg 1 of the 4-chain sovereign indexer).**
  The committed 8-contract belt (`7408ceb`) is now LIVE on Railway, synced to head, sovereign (`is_hyper_sync=false`), following tip.
  - **Deploy hit 2 pre-existing bugs (both fixed, config-only) — see KF-013:**
    1. **envio Rust CLI `28P01` on `persisted_state`** (SCRAM-over-SSL channel binding) while JS runtime authed fine with the same correct password. **Fix: Railway var `ENVIO_PG_SSL_MODE=false`** on belt-indexer (was `prefer`). KEEP THIS SET (+ for all future legs).
    2. **Chain `start_block` floor (3837808, 2-contract-era leftover) > BgtToken start_block (8221)** → envio rejects. **Fix: `config.mibera.yaml` chain floor → 8221** (committed-pending).
  - **Re-init mechanism (factory rule for future legs):** envio `isInitialized()` checks table-existence NOT config-hash → a plain redeploy RESUMES + silently skips new contracts. Force fresh init: **`Dockerfile.belt` CMD now env-gated** (`${ENVIO_RESTART:+--restart}`) → set Railway var `ENVIO_RESTART=1` → deploy → backfill → **delete the var** → redeploy (resumes). (committed-pending Dockerfile change.)
  - **Sync metric (#1):** dense 8-contract sovereign-eRPC cold sync **≈ 60 min to head** (21.16M blk), ~12× the 2-contract ~5 min. **Zero 429 stalls** — KF-012 A+B eRPC fix held. **Completeness PASS** (ground-truth exact: MiberaTransfer 39,714 / MintActivity 10,000 / MiberaLoan 176). **Bottleneck = BgtToken QueueBoost (BgtBoostEvent 1.38M)** — flag for score-api: does validator_booster need full history from block 8221, or would a later start_block do?
  - `/backing` restored on the ecosystem belt (gateway + CORS for honeyroad.xyz verified). `persisted_state` stays empty but resume reads `chain_metadata`/`checkpoints` (not persisted_state) → restart-durable.
  - **COMMITTED:** `7f75810` (Berachain deploy fixes + KF-013) · `3c5f091` (4-chain BUILD — Base/OP/ETH config + handlers; codegen+typecheck exit 0, DISS-001 holds across 14 contracts/4 chains).
  - **4-chain build DONE (config + handlers); DEPLOY pending with 3 gates:**
    1. **erpc.yaml** needs Base/OP/ETH upstream groups + networks[] + per-upstream getLogs verification (KF-012 WILL recur — op-stack getLogs-liar confirmed for Base; verify before trusting). config.mibera.yaml chain blocks already point at eRPC routes /8453 /10 /1.
    2. **Dense chains → HyperSync likely:** FriendtechShares (Base, all Trades from blk 2.43M) + MiladyCollection (ETH, all Milady transfers from blk 13.09M) are high-volume, unindexed-arg → eRPC backfill = hours. Bounded HyperSync needs a free `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` (envio.dev/app/api-tokens — operator account). OP is sparse (eRPC viable).
    3. **score-api repoint** = set `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` on the **`score-api` Railway project** (NOT freeside-sonar) → needs separate access; current `~/.railway-token` is freeside-sonar-scoped.
  - **LONGEVITY DECISION (operator, 2026-05-21): eRPC for ALL 4 chains, NO HyperSync.** Rationale: HyperSync-backfill→eRPC-realtime would require swapping the data source back-and-forth on every future re-init (toil), AND free HyperSync credits would cap on exactly the dense one-time backfills (friend.tech/Milady millions of events). Pure eRPC = sovereign, one source per chain, no swap, no caps = the sovereign-data thesis. config.mibera.yaml already has all 4 on eRPC (aligned). HyperSync token saved at `~/.envio-api-token` as break-glass only; NOT used. **Dense-chain caveat:** free public RPC will likely 429-cap on Base/ETH (worse than Bera); if the deploy measurement confirms, the longevity answer is **paid archive RPC as an eRPC upstream** (deliberate small spend, sovereign-routed) or own nodes — decided empirically after measuring.
  - **✅ ALL 4 CHAINS LIVE (2026-05-21) — Mibera ecosystem sovereign indexer COMPLETE.** Bera + Base + OP + ETH synced to head + following tip. Sources: Bera/ETH/OP = free eRPC (sovereign); Base = HyperSync (friend.tech break-glass; commit `039afbd`). All score-api entities present via gateway (MiberaLoan 176 · MiberaTransfer 39,714 · MintActivity 10,000 · NftBurn 39 · BgtBoostEvent 1.47M · Erc1155MintEvent 7,607 · Action 2.07M · FriendtechTrade 1,317 · PaddleSupply 363 · MintEvent 3,588 · MiberaStakedToken 1,603 · TreasuryActivity 11,819). `/backing` live. **Commits this push:** `06ae686` (eRPC 4-chain + .railwayignore) · `f5ba8c4` (KF-013 correction) · `039afbd` (Base→HyperSync). **REMAINING:** (a) ✅ DONE — rigorous reconciliation PASS: Bera exact (176/39,714/10,000), ETH Milady burns 24=on-chain(→0xdead), OP MiberaZora mints 4,546=on-chain, Base HyperSync-authoritative (jani 469+cfang 848). No getLogs-liar loss on any free-eRPC chain. (b) ✅ HANDED OFF — score-api repoint → gateway URL filed as **`0xHoneyJar/score-api#151`** (assigned notzerker), with reconciliation + coverage + validation steps. Zerker wires `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` on score-api Railway. (c) cleanups — revoke `~/.railway-token`, rotate secrets, extend `verify-belt-config` to the new chains (currently Berachain-only); (d) optional longevity: Base → eRPC sovereign-realtime (paid archive RPC) / own-nodes endgame. ENVIO_API_TOKEN is set on belt-indexer (Base HyperSync) — keep.
  - **DEPLOY IN PROGRESS (2026-05-21, operator: "outage okay, stabilize"):** eRPC extended to 4 chains (`erpc.yaml` committed `06ae686`; deployed + verified healthy — all 4 networks bootstrap state:ready), then belt re-init. **The re-init pattern (corrected — see KF-013):** `--restart` does NOT backfill (it seeds schema + chain_metadata rows for all config chains, then the Rust-CLI persisted_state upsert CRASHES 28P01 on fresh-init — `ENVIO_PG_SSL_MODE=false` does NOT fix it). The actual sequence that works: set `ENVIO_RESTART=1` → `railway up` (seeds + crashes) → **delete `ENVIO_RESTART` → redeploy → RESUME backfills** the seeded chains (resume skips the fatal upsert). New chains MUST be seeded via `--restart` first (resume ignores config chains absent from chain_metadata). Belt runs fine without persisted_state (resume reads chain_metadata/checkpoints).
  - **`railway up` gotcha:** broken symlinks under `.claude/skills/*` (→ uninstalled archivist pack) crash `railway up`'s file indexer. Fixed with `.railwayignore` (committed `06ae686`) excluding `.claude` + non-build dirs (also slims upload 1.9MB).
  - **EMPIRICAL FINDING (the cost-envelope fork):** free eRPC backfills all 4 chains sovereignly — sparse chains FAST (ETH sparse regions ~35k blk/s, OP fast), but **dense regions THROTTLE to hundreds of blk/s** (ETH Milady mint-era ~164 blk/s; Base friend.tech slow — fetches ALL Trades, handler filters to jani/cfang). No 429-stalls, just slow → **dense-chain full backfill = HOURS**. For longevity, the dense chains (Base/ETH) would sync far faster on **paid archive RPC** (deliberate small spend) — free eRPC works but is slow for them. /backing restores when **Berachain** re-syncs to head (~60-150min); Base/ETH continue in background. Repoint still deferred.
  - **CLEANUP (not yet — token still needed for deploy):** revoke `~/.railway-token`; rotate belt-hasura admin secret + Postgres-3vIC password; remove harmless extra belt-indexer vars (PGPASSWORD/PGUSER/PGHOST/PGDATABASE/PGPORT — added during KF-013 debug, not load-bearing; ENVIO_PG_SSL_MODE=false IS load-bearing). Base RPC research: `grimoires/k-hole/research-output/dig-session-2026-05-21.md`.
- indexer-belt-rebuild **RE-SPRINTED against SDD r4 §12** (2026-05-19, `/sprint-plan`) —
  `sprint.md` regenerated for the L0–L6 bottom-up stack: **S0** eRPC calibration spike →
  **S1** build the eRPC L2 substrate (`erpc.yaml` + dedicated Railway service + cache
  Postgres) → **S2** re-point the Mibera belt to eRPC + verify → **S3** L5 gateway / §7
  observability / hardening / staged handback. 18 tasks across 4 sprints.
- The completed belt-config Sprint 1 (`config.mibera.yaml` + `verify-belt-config.js` +
  `src/belts/mibera/`) is **reused, not redone** — S2-T1 modifies the existing config's
  data-source key only (`hypersync_config` → `rpc_config` → eRPC). r3's HyperSync data
  source is retired by r4.
- Ledger: `indexer-belt-rebuild` cycle registered (was previously unregistered) —
  4 sprints, global ids 168–171; `active_cycle` set to `indexer-belt-rebuild`. Note:
  the completed belt-config Sprint 1 predates ledger registration and is not
  retroactively listed.
- S0 COMPLETE (2026-05-20) — free public Berachain RPC + eRPC cold-sync measured
  (~39k blk/s cold, ~192k warm, 0 rate-limiting; encouraging for H1).
- **S1-T1 COMPLETE + review+audit APPROVED** (2026-05-20, `/run sprint-1`) — `erpc.yaml`
  authored + eRPC-v0.0.64-validated; `/review-sprint` "All good (with noted concerns)";
  `/audit-sprint` "APPROVED - LETS FUCKING GO" (0 CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM); both cross-model
  dissents clean. `COMPLETED` marker written (scoped to the run's S1-T1 autonomous scope).
  Run JACKED_OUT — hands back. Ledger: S0→completed, **S1 (169)→in_progress** (NOT
  completed — T2-T4 pending).
- **S1 COMPLETE — eRPC L2 substrate live on Railway** (2026-05-20, operator-paired):
  - S1-T2 — `freeside-sonar` Railway project (the honey jar ws, id `e240cdf0`) created;
    `Postgres` cache service + `erpc` service deployed. `erpc` builds from `Dockerfile.erpc`
    (digest-pinned eRPC v0.0.64 + baked-in `erpc.yaml`); `ERPC_DATABASE_URL` →
    `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (private ref, no inline secret).
  - S1-T3 — cache Postgres = Railway default size ("start small" per OD-2 / R-4).
  - S1-T4 — smoke-verified: eRPC answers `80094` JSON-RPC (chainId `0x138de`, blockNumber,
    getLogs 9270 logs); a repeated finalized getLogs is **served from cache** (log-confirmed
    — `ttl: 0` = cache-forever; audit Concern-1 / the `ttl:0` assumption RETIRED); failover
    observed (publicnode 503'd, eRPC served via the other 3; all 4 upstreams synced).
  - **Deploy findings folded into `erpc.yaml`**: eRPC needs `httpHostV6: "::"` — Railway
    routes to containers over IPv6, IPv4-only bind → 502 (S0 missed it: local Docker is
    IPv4). `logLevel` warn→info for the verification window — REVERT to warn at cycle
    steady-state. The eRPC image EXPOSEs 3 ports (4000/4001/6060) → a Railway public domain
    needs an explicit `targetPort: 4000` (runbook note; private networking is unaffected).
  - eRPC internal address for S2: `http://erpc.railway.internal:4000/main/evm/80094`.
  - Residual: temp public smoke-test domain `erpc-production-0437.up.railway.app` — removal
    staged via config patch; if it lingers, remove in Railway dashboard (Settings→Networking).
- **S2-T1 COMPLETE + review+audit APPROVED** (2026-05-20, `/run sprint-2`) —
  `config.mibera.yaml` chains[0] data source `hypersync_config` → `rpc`
  (`http://erpc.railway.internal:4000/main/evm/80094`, `for: sync` — eRPC as primary
  source, not a HyperSync fallback); `verify-belt-config.js` green; `/review-sprint`
  "All good (with noted concerns)"; `/audit-sprint` "APPROVED" (0 CRIT/HIGH/MED); both
  cross-model dissents clean. Ledger: **S2 (170) → in_progress** (NOT completed — T2-T5
  pending). `COMPLETED` marker scoped to the run's S2-T1 autonomous scope.
  - **Finding (drift_resolution: code)**: SDD §4.1 / sprint.md S2-T1 say `rpc_config`;
    installed Envio v3.0.0-alpha.14 schema field is `rpc` (no `rpc_config`). Implemented
    with the correct `rpc` — SDD §4.1 text should be reconciled `rpc_config`→`rpc`.
  - **S2-T3 charge** (from review): confirm the belt's sync traffic actually reaches eRPC
    (retires the `for: sync` HyperSync-disabled assumption — eRPC `info` logs will show
    belt requests); decide `interval_ceiling: 30000` from observed getLogs behaviour.
- **S2-T2 COMPLETE — belt build gate green** (2026-05-20, operator-paired):
  `pnpm verify:belt-config` ✓ · `pnpm codegen:mibera` (scoped, exit 0) ✓ ·
  `pnpm typecheck:mibera` (exit 0, clean) ✓. Wired as CI — `.github/workflows/belt-build.yml`
  (3-gate job; AC-11). `package.json` gains `codegen:mibera` + `typecheck:mibera` scripts.
  - **DISS-002 (S2-T2 finding — sibling of DISS-001)**: belt-scoped `envio codegen` (the
    DISS-001 fix) generates `generated/` for the 2 Mibera contracts only; a whole-repo
    `tsc --noEmit` then fails — the 27 non-belt monolith handlers import generated types
    belt-scoped codegen never produced (~210 errors: TS2305/2724 missing-member + a
    TS7031 implicit-any cascade). The belt's OWN files (`mibera-*.ts`, `src/belts/mibera/`)
    were clean. **Resolution (operator decision, 2026-05-20)**: `tsconfig.mibera.json` —
    a per-belt typecheck config rooted at `src/belts/mibera/`, typechecking only the
    belt's import closure. Factory invariant: every belt gets a `tsconfig.<belt>.json`
    (parallels `config.<belt>.yaml` + `src/belts/<belt>/`). AC-3's "`tsc --noEmit` clean"
    is met as the **belt-scoped** typecheck — whole-repo tsc is structurally incompatible
    with DISS-001's belt-scoped codegen. SDD §5 / AC-3 to be reconciled to name the
    belt-scoped gate (drift_resolution: code).
  - Also resolved an S2-T4 open question: `envio codegen` **does** support `--config`
    (v3.0.0-alpha.14) — no copy-to-`config.yaml` needed at deploy.
- **S2-T3 → DISS-003: Envio cannot sync Berachain via EITHER data source** (2026-05-20,
  operator-paired). The local dev run surfaced the cycle's pivotal finding. Root cause,
  proven end-to-end after clearing several local-debug layers:
  - **RPC sync is broken for Berachain.** With `generated/` re-codegen'd against a
    *reachable* RPC (`rpc.berachain-apis.com`) and a fresh DB, the indexer reaches the
    endpoint, pulls blocks, and **fails parsing every one**:
    `[rescript-rest] Failed parsing response at ["data"]["result"]["totalDifficulty"].
    Reason: Expected string | null, received undefined`. Envio v3.0.0-alpha.14's RPC
    block parser **requires `totalDifficulty`**; Berachain (post-merge PoS) omits it.
    eRPC is a transparent JSON-RPC proxy — belt→eRPC→public-RPC carries the SAME omission,
    so eRPC does NOT fix this unless it can inject `totalDifficulty` (unverified; not a
    default eRPC feature).
  - **HyperSync now requires a token.** Switching the source to HyperSync crashes at init:
    `An API token is required for using HyperSync as a data-source. Set ENVIO_API_TOKEN…
    get a free API token at https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens`. **This is almost certainly
    the original "fire"** — the indexer used HyperSync, HyperSync made the token mandatory,
    `/backing` broke (PRD G1).
  - **Architecture implication**: r4's premise (belt indexes Berachain over JSON-RPC
    through eRPC) is **not viable as-is** — Envio's RPC source can't parse Berachain. The
    likely simplest fix to PRD G1 is **HyperSync + a free `ENVIO_API_TOKEN`** — which
    reframes eRPC's role (the whole eRPC pivot may have been solving an avoidable problem).
  - **Local-debug layers cleared en route** (all secondary to the above): codegen embeds
    the data source — `generated/` had a stale unreachable `erpc.railway.internal` baked
    in, so config edits did nothing until re-codegen (this masked the real error as
    `knownHeight: 0`); the Ink TUI crashes non-TTY (`TUI_OFF=true`); port-9898 lingers
    across runs; `docker-credential-desktop` missing from envio's PATH (Docker.app bin).
  - **S2-T2's build gate (codegen + belt typecheck + CI) stands** — the verified S2
    checkpoint. S2-T3/T4/T5 blocked pending an architecture decision.
  - **Salvage investigation (operator chose "salvage eRPC/RPC", 2026-05-20)** — both
    RPC-salvage routes hit walls: (1) **eRPC does NOT inject `totalDifficulty`** — ran
    eRPC locally (docker) against the public cluster; its `eth_getBlockByNumber` passes
    the upstream response through unchanged (no `totalDifficulty`). Not a default feature.
    (2) **Envio alpha.14 → 3.0.0 stable is a BREAKING bump** — stable's handler-
    registration API differs; the reused handlers register zero events
    (`Invalid configuration: Nothing to fetch on chain 80094 … eventConfigs=0`), so the
    bump can't even reach the `totalDifficulty` stage to confirm a fix. (Pinned
    `3.0.0-alpha.14`; stable `3.0.0` / next `3.0.1` exist.) Reverted; tree clean.
    **Net**: salvaging RPC needs EITHER a custom `totalDifficulty`-injection shim (new
    code) OR a full Envio alpha→stable migration (handler-API rewrite, monolith-wide,
    then re-test) — neither is quick. **HyperSync + a free `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` remains the
    simplest restore for PRD G1.**
  - **RESOLUTION (2026-05-20, validated): bump Envio alpha.14 → alpha.16 — the sovereign
    path holds.** Per Envio [#994](https://github.com/enviodev/hyperindex/issues/994) /
    [#998](https://github.com/enviodev/hyperindex/pull/998) the totalDifficulty parse bug is
    fixed from **alpha.16**. Tested alpha.16 (invoking the platform binary directly — see bin
    caveat): codegen clean; **no `eventConfigs=0`** (handler API preserved — the break is only
    at *stable* 3.0.0, NOT the alphas); and **no totalDifficulty error** on two fresh endpoints.
    The only remaining error is per-endpoint rate-limiting (Cloudflare 1015 on berachain-apis;
    QuickNode `-32008` 250/min on berachain.com) — **exactly what eRPC absorbs** (hedge across
    the 4-endpoint cluster + finalized-block cache). Validated sovereign architecture:
    **belt → eRPC → free Berachain RPC cluster, on envio alpha.16+** — no HyperSync, no token,
    no hosted dependency. The ~40-line totalDifficulty-injection shim (PoC proven) is the alpha.14
    fallback; alpha.16 makes it unnecessary.
    - **Bin caveat (adoption detail)**: `envio@3.0.0-alpha.16` npm package has NO `bin` field
      (alpha.14 had `bin: ./bin.js`); pnpm didn't link `envio`, so `pnpm envio` fails. The
      platform binary lives at `node_modules/.pnpm/envio-darwin-arm64@.../bin/envio`. Adoption
      must pin an alpha (16–24) whose package re-exposes a working bin, OR invoke the platform
      binary directly in Railway build/start commands. (HyperSync server is closed-source — no
      self-host; eRPC can't inject response fields — both confirmed by web research.)
- **DISS-003 FIX APPLIED (2026-05-20): pinned `envio@3.0.0-alpha.17`** (expert-endorsed
  "A-prime"). alpha.17 = PR #998 totalDifficulty fix **+ the alpha.15/16 binary-packaging fix**
  (resolves the alpha.16 bin caveat — `pnpm envio` works again) **+ below the alpha.23 "New
  Handlers API" break** (handlers stay unchanged). Validated: `pnpm envio` ✓ · codegen ✓ ·
  `typecheck:mibera` ✓ · `verify-belt-config` ✓ · `envio start` reaches "Starting indexing"
  (eventConfigs>0) with no totalDifficulty error. Exact version pin (no caret). config.mibera.yaml
  unchanged (belt → eRPC; exact start_blocks already set, not genesis). Committed.
  - **Forward plan (from the expert consult)**: (1) **benchmark eRPC cold-sync** on a 100k–250k
    block slice — decide if a one-time *bounded* HyperSync+token backfill is needed for the cold
    sync (then continue sovereign on eRPC, with event-count reconciliation); (2) keep the
    totalDifficulty shim (PoC) as a *disabled-but-deployable* break-glass only — alpha.17 makes it
    unnecessary; (3) toward true sovereignty: run our **own Berachain node** behind eRPC (eRPC today
    = sovereign routing/cache, not sovereign data origin); (4) **stable V3 migration LATER, by
    EXTRACTION** — migrate the /backing belt to stable's `indexer.onEvent` API first, then the
    ~30-handler monolith — not a monolith-shock bump.
- **S2-T3 EMISSION PROOF — substantively PASS (2026-05-20, operator-paired)**, with two HIGH
  infrastructure findings surfaced + fixed (config-only). Local run: belt → local eRPC (4 public
  upstreams) → Berachain; Postgres :5433 / Hasura :8080 (secret "testing"); envio alpha.17.
  - **3 §6 queries**: ① `MiberaLoan` non-empty ✅ · ② `MiberaTransfer` non-empty ✅ ·
    ③ `MintActivity{amountPaid>0}` ⚠️ **UNSATISFIABLE BY REALITY** — `max(amountPaid)=0` across
    all 10,000 mints; **Mibera was a 100% free mint** (belt `amountPaid` matches on-chain tx
    `value=0` exactly via `eth_getTransactionByHash` — the §5 `value` field PROVABLY flows; there
    is simply no paid mint to match the predicate). AC-4 substance (both handlers emit correct,
    contract-scoped data) is MET. **Recommend reconciling the AC**: query 3's "≥1 row amountPaid>0"
    cannot pass for a free-mint collection — replace with a value-flow check that holds (e.g.
    assert MintActivity rows exist AND amountPaid is a populated bigint field), or drop the `_gt:0`.
  - **FINDING A — silent getLogs data loss (HIGH).** `rpc.berachain-apis.com` returns empty `[]`
    with **HTTP 200** for historical *filtered* `eth_getLogs` (proven 0 logs vs publicnode's
    9306/176/6/1 across 4 ranges; lies at ALL window sizes incl. 2k; serves blocks fine). eRPC's
    `markEmptyAsErrorMethods` does **not** include `eth_getLogs`, and eRPC's hedge takes the first
    non-error answer — so berachain-apis (the FASTEST responder ~85ms) wins the race and its lie is
    accepted. First cold sync silently dropped ~95% of logs (585 transfers, **0 mints**). Invisible
    to the DISS-003 "Starting indexing" check — only a data-completeness pass catches it. See KF-012.
  - **FINDING B — per-IP rate-limit stall (HIGH, coupled to A).** Removing berachain-apis entirely
    fixed completeness (10,000 mints) but put all block/tx + getLogs load on publicnode → Cloudflare
    429 with multi-minute `retry-after` → sync froze at block 3,965,807 (0.7%). Root cause = a
    per-second rate burst spiral in dense regions, NOT a long ban (all upstreams recover in seconds
    once load stops).
  - **PROVEN FIX (config-only; sovereign path holds — no HyperSync/token):**
    1. `berachain-apis` → `ignoreMethods: [eth_getLogs]` (keep it for block/tx load; route it OFF
       the method it lies on). eRPC `ignoreMethods` empirically verified (isolation test: getLogs →
       `-32601 method ignored`, chainId/getBlock → OK).
    2. Widen getLogs cluster 3 → 5: add **tenderly** `https://berachain.gateway.tenderly.co`
       (no key, archive, NO range cap / 50k-result) + **sentio** `https://berachain.rpc.sentio.xyz`
       (no key, archive, 10k cap). Research-verified live (the others probed: ankr/swiftnodes/1rpc
       key-required or dead — see session research output).
    3. Per-upstream eRPC `rateLimitBudget` (~25 req/s each) to PACE outbound rate under the free
       endpoints' punitive 429 budget; **drop hedge** (it doubles load under pacing).
  - **BENCHMARK (definitive, corrected+paced+widened):** full **17.3M-block cold sync to HEAD in
    ~5 min**; complete data — MiberaTransfer **39,714**, MintActivity **10,000**, MiberaLoan **176**;
    earliest event now a mint @ 3,838,974 (was a 4.46M secondary). 162 transient 429s, **never
    stalled**. (Earlier broken/stalled runs: 585 transfers / stall @ 0.7%.)
  - **Local-only artifacts (NOT committed):** `/tmp/erpc-local.yaml` (memory cache + the fix),
    `config.mibera.yaml` url/interval edits (REVERTED to committed eRPC-internal URL).
  - **FIX LANDED + VALIDATED (operator chose "land fix + reconcile", 2026-05-20):** committed
    `erpc.yaml` edited with the 3 Finding A+B changes — (1) `berachain-apis` `ignoreMethods:[eth_getLogs]`,
    (2) +tenderly +sentio upstreams (5 getLogs nodes), (3) per-upstream `rateLimitBudget` 25/s + hedge
    removed. Boot-validated end-to-end: the committed config (postgres cache + new sections) loads
    "ready", chainId ✓, getLogs deploy-window 9306 ✓. Belt build gate still green (verify / codegen /
    typecheck:mibera). **NOT committed to git** — awaiting operator review (erpc.yaml is reviewed infra).
    Caveat: 25/s pacing + ~5-min ETA are LOCAL data points (burned IP, memory cache) — re-validate at
    S2-T4 against the Railway egress IP.
  - **S2-T5 / AC-6 RECONCILIATION — PASS ✅ (2026-05-20).** Independently read on-chain
    `MiberaLiquidBacking` (verified ABI via routescan) at pinned block 21,150,981 (belt's synced head):
    `backingLoanId()=176` (== belt totalLoansCreated); enumerated `backingLoanDetails(0..175)`, active =
    `loanedTo != 0x0` (confirmed: repaid loan 0 + defaulted loan 7 both have loanedTo=0). **On-chain
    active set EXACTLY equals belt active set — both 19 IDs [134,135,136,137,146-155,163,164,165,174,175],
    only-on-chain=[], only-belt=[].** The belt data is complete AND correct vs chain. (`backingLoanExpired`
    is a state-MUTATING fn with no outputs — SDD §6 mislabels it as readable; the discriminator is
    `backingLoanDetails.loanedTo`. Recommend reconciling SDD §6 wording.)
  - **S2-T4 COMPLETE — belt LIVE on Railway (2026-05-20, driven via railway CLI w/ project token).**
    `freeside-sonar`/production now runs: `erpc` (rebuilt w/ A+B fix — 6 upstreams incl tenderly/sentio),
    `Postgres` (eRPC cache), `Postgres-3vIC` (belt DB), `belt-hasura` (graphql-engine v2.43), `belt-indexer`
    (Dockerfile.belt). **Belt cold-synced to head sovereignly through eRPC** (chain_metadata: latest_processed
    21,156,792 = head, is_hyper_sync=false, 51,818 events, first_event 3,838,974 = mint captured). Data
    COMPLETE + CORRECT, byte-identical to local: MiberaTransfer 39,714 · MintActivity 10,000 · MiberaLoan 176.
    **AC-6 on Railway: totalActiveLoans=19**, active IDs identical to the on-chain-reconciled set. Public
    GraphQL (anonymous `public` role) verified live: `https://belt-hasura-production.up.railway.app/v1/graphql`.
  - **S2-T4 deploy gotchas (factory learnings — folded into runbook):**
    1. **Dockerfile.belt needs `node:22`** — envio alpha.17 handler autoload uses `fs.promises.glob` (Node ≥22);
       node:20 crashes `Promises.glob is not a function`. (Build passes on 20; runtime crashes.)
    2. **eRPC redeploy:** the GitHub-triggered build had failed ("couldn't locate Dockerfile.erpc in code
       archive"); deployed via `railway up -s erpc -c` (local upload w/ Dockerfile.erpc) instead.
    3. **Image services (`railway add -i`) don't auto-deploy** — nudge the first deploy with a var-set.
    4. **`RAILWAY_RUN_COMMAND` is IGNORED for Dockerfile services** — can't inject `--restart` via env.
    5. **Hasura tracking is the big one:** envio runs "Tracking tables in Hasura" ONLY on FRESH storage init,
       NOT on resume. The belt's first start tracked 0 tables (belt-hasura private DNS was seconds-old →
       silent failure), and every resume skips tracking. **Fix applied: manually tracked 94 entity tables +
       `public` SELECT (allow_aggregations) via the Hasura metadata API** (`pg_track_table` +
       `pg_create_select_permission`) — idempotent, no re-sync, replicates exactly what envio does. **Factory
       rule: deploy belt-postgres → belt-hasura (confirm healthy) → belt-indexer LAST; if GraphQL shows
       `field not found in query_root`, run the manual-track step (see runbook).**
    6. **belt-indexer stdout logs barely stream on Railway** (envio non-TUI buffering) — verify via the DB
       (`chain_metadata`) + Hasura metadata, not `railway logs`. Investigate for S3 observability.
  - **CLEANUP / FOLLOW-UPS (operator):** (a) remove the stray PUBLIC domain accidentally created on
    `belt-indexer` (`belt-indexer-production-645f.up.railway.app` — it's a worker, 502s; dashboard removal —
    no CLI remove). (b) ROTATE the belt-hasura admin secret + Postgres-3vIC password (both appeared in the
    session transcript; internal/low-risk but rotate before/at handback). (c) revoke the temporary Railway
    project token (`~/.railway-token`) when CLI driving is done. (d) `~/.railway-belt-hasura-secret` holds the
    current admin secret locally.
  - **S3 IN PROGRESS (2026-05-20, driven). T1 ✅ T2 ✅ T4 ✅ T6 ✅ | T3 + T5 + T7 = operator-paired.**
    - **S3-T1 ✅ L5 gateway (AC-13).** `belt-gateway` (Caddy + caddy-ratelimit, `Dockerfile.gateway` + `Caddyfile`)

      `BELT_UPSTREAM=belt-hasura.railway.internal:8080`, federation-ready (additive Caddyfile route; public URL
      unchanged). **Swap verified:** bad upstream→502, revert→live data. Recovery = set `BELT_UPSTREAM` + redeploy.
    - **S3-T2 ✅ hardening (AC-12).** Per-IP rate limit 120/min keyed on `{client_ip}` (XFF; `trusted_proxies
      private_ranges` for Railway's edge) + 50KB request-body cap (verified: 60KB→413, small→200). The module is
      loaded + enforced; empirical 429 not triggerable from this session's rotating egress IP — verify from a
      single IP. **Fast-follow:** precise GraphQL depth/complexity cap (graphql-armor proxy or Hasura allowlist) —
      the body cap is the interim coarse guard.
    - **S3-T4 ✅ score-api empty-safe audit (AC-9, HARD GATE) — PASS.** `grimoires/loa/a2a/sprint-3/score-api-empty-safe-audit.md`.

      UNBLOCKED. Carry-forward: if belt DB is wiped+resumed without re-track, re-run the manual track first.
    - **S3-T6 ✅ schema unchanged (AC-10).** `git diff main…indexer-belt-rebuild -- schema.graphql` = empty.
    - **S3-T3 ⏳ observability (operator-paired — needs alert channel).** Recommended: Railway healthchecks →
      `erpc` `/healthcheck`, `belt-hasura` `/healthz`; sync-lag monitor = compare `chain_metadata.latest_processed_block`
      vs eRPC head, alert if lag > ~300 blocks / 10 min (note: belt-indexer stdout barely streams — monitor via DB,
      not logs); Postgres ≥80% disk alerts on belt + cache PG. Needs an ops channel (Slack webhook / Railway notif).
    - **S3-T5 ⏳ handback (operator-paired, ONE-WAY).** After a soak (≥2h synced-to-head + healthcheck green):
      repoint mibera-honeyroad `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIO_URL` (Vercel) → the gateway URL above; confirm `/backing` renders.
      Then (after S3-T4 ✅) score-api `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` → gateway URL. Both → the **gateway** URL, never the raw
      belt URL (so recovery = gateway swap). This is the operator's Vercel flip.
    - **S3-T7 ⏳ E2E goal validation** — after T5 (load live `/backing`).
    - Services now: erpc, Postgres(cache), Postgres-3vIC(belt DB), belt-hasura, belt-indexer, **belt-gateway**.
  - **S3-T5 step 1 DONE — honeyroad.xyz/backing RESTORED on production (2026-05-20, operator-requested, no full soak).**
    PRD **G1 achieved live.** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIO_URL` = `https://belt-gateway-production.up.railway.app/v1/graphql`
    + `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_BANNER=false` on Vercel, redeployed → honeyroad.xyz now renders Total Backing
    31,632.007, the backing-per-NFT floor-value chart, and live Recent-Activity mints. Verified via browser +
    the gateway returns 200 w/ CORS allow-origin honeyroad.xyz; old hosted indexer (indexer.hyperindex.xyz)
    confirmed DOWN ("Failed to fetch") — the original fire.
    - **CRITICAL project-mapping learning:** the repo `0xHoneyJar/mibera-honeyroad` deploys to the Vercel project
      **`mibera-interface`** (domain **honeyroad.xyz**) — NOT the `mibera-honeyroad` Vercel project (whose builds
      have ALL errored 5+ days, missing DATABASE_URL; it's dead/abandoned). I first (harmlessly) set the env +
      a failed build on the dead `mibera-honeyroad` project before finding the live one. **For score-api leg +
      future: target the `mibera-interface` Vercel project / honeyroad.xyz.**
    - The `/backing` "indexer down" strip was env-driven: `MAINTENANCE_BANNER = NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_BANNER !== "false"`
      (defaults ON) — set to `false` to clear it.
    - **Vercel deploy gotcha:** `vercel --prod` from local FAILED on the dead project (no DATABASE_URL); the working
      path was `vercel redeploy <last-good-prod>` on mibera-interface (rebuilds the live commit + current project
      env, which has DATABASE_URL). `vercel redeploy` DID bake the new NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars (data loaded → env applied).
  - **REMAINING / CLEANUP:** (a) **score-api leg (S3-T5 step 2)** — repoint score-api `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` → the gateway
    (S3-T4 audit PASSED → unblocked); operator-paired. (b) stray env var + failed build on the DEAD `mibera-honeyroad`
    Vercel project — harmless (never serves), remove if desired. (c) S3-T3 observability (needs alert channel) — esp.
    a sync-lag monitor since the flip skipped the ≥2h soak (verify belt realtime keeps up). (d) revoke `~/.railway-token`;
    rotate belt-hasura admin secret + Postgres-3vIC password. (e) S3-T7 E2E: G1 ✅ live; G2/G3 ✅ (factory + one-env-var
    recovery + schema unchanged).

## Prior Focus (superseded by r4 re-sprint)
- indexer-belt-rebuild Sprint 1 COMPLETE (2026-05-20, `/run sprint-1`) —
  `config.mibera.yaml` + `verify-belt-config` + belt entrypoint; implement→review→audit
  all APPROVED (commits 1052125, 8cb08ce, 9a97c1a).

## Decisions
- Installed Loa framework with full configuration matching midi-interface setup
- /ride 2026-05-19: regenerated all reality artifacts. Framework cycle-112 PRD/SDD
  archived to `archive/cycle-112-*-framework.md`; `prd.md`/`sdd.md` now document the
  indexer itself.
- Phase 8 (legacy deprecation) deliberately skipped — README/SCALE/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE
  are active operational docs, not superseded. See `trajectory-audit.md`.
- Sprint 1 (indexer-belt-rebuild · `/run sprint-1` · 2026-05-20): authored
  `config.mibera.yaml` (S1-T1) + `scripts/verify-belt-config.js` + `test/verify-belt-config.test.ts`
  (S1-T2). Belt config is a verbatim extract of `config.yaml`'s 2 Mibera contracts; the
  verify gate mechanically enforces field_selection/address/start_block fidelity (SDD
  §5.3). AC-2 + AC-11 met; 9/9 tests pass. No `src/` changes. beads bd-3eb/bd-11o closed.
- Discovered, pre-existing, NOT introduced by Sprint 1 (logged, not fixed — Karpathy
  surgical-changes; the full `codegen + tsc` build gate is Sprint 2 / S2-T3):
  bd-1kg — `src/handlers/sf-vaults.ts` fails `tsc --noEmit` (~7 errors; surfaced when
  `node_modules` was hydrated to the lockfile — stale `typescript 5.2.2` had masked them;
  `sf-vaults` is an archived contract; `generated/` is stale (Feb 15) so S2-T3 codegen
  may resolve). bd-3nb — no `vitest.config` → `pnpm test` sweeps the whole repo (296
  framework files fail to collect); `test/fatbera-core.test.ts` imports removed `chai`.
- `node_modules` was stale (pre-vitest mocha/chai era) — hydrated via
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; `package.json` + `pnpm-lock.yaml` unchanged.
- Sprint 1 review (2026-05-20) — BLOCKING cross-model finding DISS-001 (bd-12q): a
  belt-scoped `config.mibera.yaml` cannot build against the monolith barrel
  `src/EventHandlers.ts` (scoped `envio codegen` → `generated/` missing 39 contracts →
  their handler modules fail to resolve). SDD §3.2 "handlers reused as-is, zero code
  changes" + `sprint.md:22` "no handler changes anywhere" are incompatible with a
  scoped config + monolith entrypoint — an SDD-level gap, not an implementation defect.
- **Decision (operator, 2026-05-20, `/run sprint-1`)**: amend SDD §3.2 / `sprint.md:22`
  in effect — per-belt handler **registration entrypoints** are permitted as additive
  scaffolding (handler *logic* unchanged). Deployment #1 adds `src/EventHandlers.mibera.ts`;
  HoneyJar/Purupuru/Sprawl belts will each get their own. config.mibera.yaml's `handler:`
  fields repoint to it; `verify-belt-config` refined to compare field_selection/address/
  start_block excluding the `handler:` line (SDD §5.3's actual scope). Formal SDD
  reconciliation deferred (drift_resolution: code).
- DISS-001 fix CORRECTED (cycle 3, 2026-05-20): the cycle-2 belt entrypoint was
  necessary but insufficient. Envio's `HandlerLoader.registerAllHandlers` always runs
  `autoLoadFromSrcHandlers(config.handlers)` — globs the top-level `handlers:` directory
  (defaults `src/handlers`) and imports every module, independent of the per-contract
  `handler:` field (verified vs `node_modules/envio/src/HandlerLoader.res.mjs`). Fix:
  belt entrypoint relocated to `src/belts/mibera/EventHandlers.mibera.ts`;
  `config.mibera.yaml` gains top-level `handlers: src/belts/mibera`. Factory-model unit
  is a per-belt directory `src/belts/<belt>/`. Autoload glob scope verified empirically.
- S0 (re-sprint, 2026-05-20): eRPC calibration spike — 4 public Berachain 80094 RPC
  endpoints verified (anonymous, no keys); cold-sync measured ~39k blk/s cold /
  ~192k warm (4.9x cache), 0 rate-limiting; extrapolated full cold-sync
  minutes-to-low-hours. H1 strongly encouraging. See `grimoires/loa/spikes/s0-erpc-calibration.md`.
- S1 (re-sprint eRPC L2, `/run sprint-1`, 2026-05-20): **S1-T1 done** — `erpc.yaml`
  authored (4 Berachain public upstreams + postgresql cache + reorg-safe finalized/
  unfinalized policies + hedge/retry/timeout failsafe; multi-chain-additive; zero inline
  secrets; schema-validated vs eRPC v0.0.64). **S1-T2/T3/T4 are operator-paired** Railway
  infra (dedicated eRPC service + cache Postgres, sizing, deployed-URL smoke-verify) —
  designated `(operator-paired)` in `sprint.md`; the run does S1-T1 then hands back. S1
  is not COMPLETE until the operator does T2-T4.

## /ride Results (2026-05-19)
- Target: thj-envio (freeside-sonar) — THJ Envio HyperIndex V3 indexer
- Handlers documented: 84 event handlers across 31 modules
- Entities: 93 GraphQL types | Contracts: 41 definitions | Chains: 6
- Drift score: 8.5/10 (0 ghosts, 0 hallucinations, 4 stale, 2 shadows)
- Consistency score: 8/10
- Governance gaps: 3 (no indexer release tags, CHANGELOG/SECURITY scope mismatch)
- Tech debt: 5 TODOs, 0 FIXME/HACK — LOW density

## Key Findings (for human decision)
- CRITICAL hygiene: Loa framework content (docs/, tests/, CHANGELOG.md, simstim/,
  lib/, tools/, evals/) is mixed into the indexer repo root. Indexer code is `src/`
  + `config.yaml` + `schema.graphql` only. See `reality/hygiene-report.md`.
- `BERACHAIN_TESTNET_ID = 80094` is mislabeled — 80094 is mainnet. Rename via /implement.
- `seaport.ts` handler exists but its config contract is commented out — decide fate.
- Only 1 indexer test (`test/fatbera-core.test.ts`) for 84 handlers — coverage risk.

## Blockers

None. (bd-1ra resolved 2026-05-20 — `origin` + `upstream` remotes configured;
`indexer-belt-rebuild` pushed; draft PR #13 open on `0xHoneyJar/sonar-api`.)

## NEXT PHASE — Mibera ecosystem sovereign indexer (score-api restoration) — DIRECTION LOCKED 2026-05-20
- **Thesis (operator):** own the Mibera/THJ ecosystem onchain data; sync-speed = the unlock; no SaaS rent;
  build our own Dune later. The **ecosystem's data layer**, not a "score-api indexer." (memory: sovereign-data-thesis)
- **Scope (Zerker-confirmed):** 4 chains (1 ETH · 10 OP · 8453 Base · 80094 Bera) / ~13 contracts / 12 entities
  (frozen schema.graphql). Map: `grimoires/loa/context/score-api-coverage-scope.md`; experiment charter +
  observations log: `grimoires/loa/context/mibera-sovereign-indexer-experiment.md`. (Arb + Zora dropped — HoneyJar-only.)
- **Locked decisions:** (Q2) artifact = **extend the Mibera belt** (these contracts ARE mibera) → one indexer →
  one Hasura → one endpoint. (Q3) build all 4 chains → validate → **ONE** score-api `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` repoint
  (no incremental). (Q1, operator lean — confirm) data source = **bounded HyperSync backfill → eRPC sovereign
  realtime**; HyperRPC paid only as last resort. (Q4) experiment resolves: sovereign viability + **sync speed**
  per chain + cost envelope + single-vs-belts. Hivemind Lab experiment (log in the charter).
- **Build plan (P-build):** extend `config.mibera.yaml` to the 4-chain footprint (pull contract event-defs from
  `config.yaml`) + wire each contract's existing handler into `src/belts/mibera` entrypoint + HyperSync backfill
  source → deploy → backfill → observe per chain → reconcile vs on-chain → repoint. Order: Berachain first
  (biggest share, eRPC ready), then Base/OP/ETH. **MiberaCollection must index ALL transfers incl. to-contracts.**
  Tests + prod-promotion rigor = before the repoint (operator deferred). Build directly (experiment frame).

## Session 2026-06-08 — per-token ownership port: CODE COMPLETE → PR #69

The Stash's last structural gap (per-token ERC-721 ownership on green) is built, reviewed, and in PR.
Driven via supervised `/coord` from loa-freeside (the orbital station): per bead → pre-scope → in-cell
agent in sonar-api → FAGAN cross-model council → **consumer-check across the Markov blanket** → fold → commit.

**DONE** (PR #69, base `feat/candies-holder-balance`, stacks on #68; supersedes stale #38):
- `bd-jyn` f69ee402 — token entity + Mibera handler (`token.owner` = raw on-chain, operator decision)
- `bd-1jg` 268457d9 — TrackedErc721Bera handler (Tarot + 10 Fractures + apdao_seat), token-only (score-api INSULATED)
- `bd-d2b` 28aff13b — GeneralMints (MST/GIF) mint-only → upsert on secondary + burn
- `bd-3nh` d7fb271d — `chain_metadata` view (design a) for inventory's `as_of_block`
- `e146eee0` (kept) pushed to #68 (its home)
- `bd-gpc` CLOSED — green is genesis-complete (Mibera = 10,000 mints = full supply; all earliest actions
  Apr–May 2025, ~1yr pre-boundary) → `bd-r90` is a STANDARD from-genesis re-run, not true-genesis-from-scratch.

**WHEN YOU RETURN** (operator-gated, in order):
1. 🔐 `bd-54c` — rotate `SONAR_SIGNING_SEED_HEX` (exposed in transcript; independent; do this FIRST).
2. Merge PR #69 (after review) → the 4 beads close on merge.
3. `bd-r90` reindex green-v3 from genesis (ADR-010, operator session; runbook
   `candies-holder-balance-reindex.md` now has the `chain_metadata` view re-apply step) → `bd-rr0` repoint
   → `bd-4kf` cutover (keep blue until green verified).
4. ⚠ `bd-beh` BLOCKS `bd-4kf`: fix `promotion-gate.js`'s green query (drop `block_height` — its Part-1
   logic only uses `latest_processed_block`) so the cutover gate can run green-side.
5. 🧹 close stale PR #38 (superseded by #69).

Follow-ups filed: `bd-0oc` (score-api fracture event feed, pre-existing + immaterial: fractures soul-bound/complete),
`bd-beh` (chain_metadata gate reconciliation, gates the cutover).
Verify (post-reindex, green): `Token(where:{collection,owner,isBurned:false}){tokenId}` returns the wallet's
Mibera + Tarot + Fractures + MST; row count ≈ blue's ~130k; conservation holds per collection.

## 2026-06-16 — KRANZ: GREEN PATH FROZEN (indexing strategy reframe → managed Envio)

⚠️ **The "WHEN YOU RETURN" green-path list above (steps 2–5: merge #69 → `bd-r90` reindex → `bd-rr0`
repoint → `bd-4kf` cutover-to-green → `bd-beh` gate-fix) is SUPERSEDED for now.** The loa-finn TCO
experiment (2026-06-16) voted to move Layer-1 **off** sovereign-Ponder to **managed Envio**. Direction
settled, NUMBER not — gated on a real billing cycle (`bd-buho`, loa-finn). Do not sink new effort into
the green/Ponder path it voted to leave.

- **Coordinate runbook (read this first):** `grimoires/loa/context/2026-06-16-phase-a-envio-standup-coordinate.md`
- **ADR (gates on bd-buho):** `grimoires/loa/context/2026-06-15-indexing-strategy-reframe-adr.md`
- **FROZEN:** session-11 WS3 (`bd-s11-erpc-1155-87l.{2,5,6,7}`), `bd-r90` green reindex, deep #72 fix
  (`bd-s11-erpc-1155-87l.4`). Revive green-v3 only enough to keep it **serving** (rollback/parity baseline).
- **DO REGARDLESS (safe, independent of the swap):** 🔐 rotate exposed `SONAR_SIGNING_SEED_HEX` (`bd-54c`);
  🧹 clean the REAL dead orphans (~$25/mo: `belt-indexer-green`, `belt-indexer` old-Envio, `belt-indexer-green-v2`,
  deleted-service volume — NOT the #71 inverted list; do NOT touch green-v3).
- **bd-4kf:** the orphan-cleanup half = found money (do it); the blue→**green** cutover half = frozen.
  After ratification, inventory cuts blue→**managed-Envio**, not blue→green.
- **Phase B (consumer repoint + Railway retirement) is HARD-GATED on bd-buho ratifying. Not yet.**
- **#69 merge:** operator judgment — committed code can merge cheaply, but `bd-r90` (the reindex that
  populates it on green) is the frozen part. See the coordinate runbook's "Open forks".

### Decision Log
- **2026-06-17 — G-A1 [ACCEPTED-DEFERRED]:** the Cloud-config field-name assertion against the *actual managed-Cloud envio version* is deferred to G-A2 (bd-7l7.5, account-gated probe). G-A1 (bd-7l7.3/.4) verified against the LOCAL `envio@3.0.0-alpha.17` schema only (codegen exit 0 both configs, grep-zero erpc). Rationale: the HyperSync field name is version-dependent (history: strip added `rpc_config`, then `05373ab7` corrected → `rpc` for alpha.17); the Cloud version may differ. Branch: `feat/envio-cloud-hypersync`. Runtime HyperSync-resolves-per-chain (esp. Berachain explicit endpoint + Base break-glass/ENVIO_API_TOKEN) is verified at the S2 canary, not by codegen.

## 2026-06-17 — RESUME POINTER: canary pushed, awaiting operator Envio deploy
- **DONE this session:** 🔐 seed rotation (`bd-54c` CLOSED — new SONAR_SIGNING_SEED_HEX on all 4 indexer Railway services, green-v3 redeployed clean). G-A1 HyperSync restore + G-A2-deferred + lazy events import.
- **Canary branch PUSHED:** `canary/envio-cloud-hypersync` → `0xHoneyJar/sonar-api` (cce33b4e). Based on PUBLIC `sonar/main` (NOT the local fork — local is 24-ahead/5-behind; reconciling that is separate estate work). 2 commits: HyperSync config (eRPC stripped, Berachain explicit) + lazy/optional `@0xhoneyjar/events` import (managed-runtime portability; 14/14 tests, codegen 0). Local worktree at `/tmp/sonar-canary` if iteration needed.
- **AWAITING OPERATOR (Envio Cloud, zksoju acct):** deploy that branch · HyperSync env only · **OMIT NATS_URL + SONAR_SIGNING_SEED_HEX** (pillar disables loudly = canary-w/o-pillar) · watch postinstall survive + 6-chain sync.
- **THEN capture (bd-buho payload):** measured $/mo (the missing number) + Cloud envio version (G-A2) + GraphQL parity vs live green + per-chain freshness → loa-finn `pnpm indexing:capture` → `indexing:read` → ratify/revise ADR → close bd-buho.
- **Events-pillar on Cloud (OQ-3) = separate track:** the private-repo postinstall means full-pillar-on-Cloud needs vendor / Envio-private-key / R1. "Delete all Railway" likely → "keep a small pillar." Decided per-track, post-measurement.

## SDD design session (2026-06-17) — Phase-A managed-Envio, grounding synthesis
- HEAD 1e812628. Envio source live at HEAD: Dockerfile.belt runs envio@3.0.0-alpha.17, BELT_CONFIG picks config.yaml (green,6ch) / config.mibera.yaml (blue).
- G-A1 nuance: installed schema field is `rpc` NOT `rpc_config` (naming-drift hazard, config.mibera.yaml:224 comment). All chains route erpc.railway.internal:4000 via `for: sync`+`for: live`. De-HyperSync commits: 01d19638/cb0c2f4e/d7f38fef. Base ALREADY uses HyperSync break-glass (ENVIO_API_TOKEN). HyperSync is Envio's DEFAULT for these chains if bare rpc removed.
- Events-pillar (src/lib/events-publisher.ts): subject = nft.mint.detected.<collectionSlug>.v1; TLS/mTLS Path-ε (PEM bodies in NATS_TLS_CA/CLIENT_CERT/CLIENT_KEY env); InMemoryPrevHashStore → genesis on restart (Sprint-1 limit). 6 Envio handlers publish: mibera-sets, puru-apiculture1155, mints, mibera-collection, mibera-zora, vm-minted. @0xhoneyjar/events vendored via scripts/rebuild-events-dist.sh from cluster-pinned loa-freeside SHA (custom postinstall+git clone in build → managed-Cloud build constraint).
- Ponder nats-publisher.ts = fuller (outbox+reorg-safe+DLQ) vs Envio events-publisher.ts = simpler (no outbox). Adopting Envio without outbox = reliability regression.
- Per-token (G-A4): ponder-runtime/src/handlers/token-projection/shared.ts — PURE collection-agnostic helper, last-write-wins (blockNumber,logIndex), `token` entity re-derivable from Transfer log. Consumer = inventory-api Stash (reads token index by contract addr). 3 beads: bd-jyn(Mibera) bd-1jg(TrackedErc721) bd-d2b(GeneralMints/MST/GIF).
- G-A5: loa-finn runbook src/research/standups/envio-hyperindex.md footprint = "93 Berachain contracts" — UNDER-SCOPED (Berachain-only). Must correct to 6-chain.
- Gateway seam: Caddyfile reverse_proxy {$BELT_UPSTREAM}, admin loopback-only :2019, swap ONLY via scripts/promote.sh (sole writer). Phase B.
- loa-finn ledger: pnpm indexing:capture add / indexing:read; hash-chained.
- Security (Flatline SKP-001 CRIT 950): rotate SONAR_SIGNING_SEED_HEX (bd-54c) NOW — independent live action. Managed deploy uses SEPARATE key (SKP-002).

## Sprint planning session (2026-06-17) — Phase-A managed-Envio
- Replaced superseded sonar-belt-factory v2.0 sprint.md with Phase-A plan (5 sprints S1-S5, global IDs 177-181). Old plan was already archived to context/sprint-sonar-belt-factory-v2-SUPERSEDED-2026-05-22.md.
- Ledger: superseded `sonar-belt-factory` cycle; created+activated `indexing-managed-envio` cycle; allocated sprints 177-181 via ledger-lib add_sprint. next_sprint_number now 182.
- Structure: S1=A.0+A.1 head (🔐 seed rotation FIRST via existing bd-54c + separate Phase-A key + G-A5/G-A1/G-A2); S2=G-A3/OQ-3 events-pillar blocker-decider + R1 contingency; S3=G-A4 per-token + §5.5 ALL-GREEN gate record (HARD clock barrier); S4=backfill+parity (pre-clock); S5=30-day measured cycle + ratify + E2E (only sprint that costs money, clock starts here).
- Two highest-risk items FRONT-LOADED per request: (1) bd-54c seed rotation = S1-T1.1 (already existed — labeled sprint:177/phase-a, NOT duplicated); (2) G-A3 in-process pillar test on Cloud canary (OQ-3: does Cloud build sandbox run rebuild-events-dist.sh postinstall?) = S2, the delete-Railway-vs-R1 decider.
- Phase B (consumer repoint + Railway teardown) explicitly OUT — hard-gated on bd-buho (loa-finn) ratifying.
- bd-buho + the loa-finn ledger are EXTERNAL deps (loa-finn repo), not created here. bd-54c is THE only pre-existing in-repo bead reused.
- Beads created: epics bd-7l7(S1) bd-658(S2) bd-4zf(S3) bd-bua(S4) bd-yqs(S5) + 20 child tasks; cross-sprint blocking deps wired (S5 gated on both S4 backfill AND S3 §5.5 gate record = the clock barrier). Conditional R1 tasks (bd-658.4/.5) flagged P1+conditional (only built on G-A3 FAIL). Resolved this session: Zora HyperSync supported (R4 closed); cost-fit not a barrier — only OQ-3 remains the genuine architectural risk.

## Sprint planning session (2026-06-17 PM) — Envio alpha.17→3.2.1 API PORT (Phase A.1-PORT, NEW cycle)
- NEW cycle `envio-3.2.1-api-port` (parent `indexing-managed-envio`); sprint plan at `grimoires/loa/cycles/envio-3.2.1-api-port/sprint.md`; 3 sprints global IDs 182/183/184; next_sprint_number now 185. The port is the canary-surfaced HARD PREREQUISITE: resolves gate G-A2 by-design and unblocks the managed deploy → 6-chain price/version → bd-buho. It slots BEFORE indexing-managed-envio S4 backfill (177-181 plan unchanged, root sprint.md untouched).
- **T0 GROUNDING CORRECTION (load-bearing).** SDD §2A.7 was grounded against the WRONG branch (`feat/envio-cloud-hypersync@d0a4034b`) and said T0 = "establish the envio@3.2.1 pin." Verified vs the actual build target `canary/envio-cloud-hypersync`: pin ALREADY present (package.json:30 `"envio":"3.2.1"`, locked pnpm-lock.yaml:1270 git:7fb1fecd), lazy @0xhoneyjar/events ✓, HyperSync ✓ (d0a4034b), FatBera merge ✓ (f888c19f). SDD's own escape clause (sdd.md:308) applies → T0 degrades to a VERIFY. REAL remaining T0: (a) remove stale `optionalDependencies.generated` (STILL present canary package.json:45-46), (b) ground 3.2.1 loader/isPreload model — 18 `(context as any).isPreload` across 7 files, tsc CANNOT catch a model change, (c) .gitignore `.envio/`+`envio-env.d.ts` (absent canary).
- Scope grounded this session (all match SDD §2A): 31 handler files; 33 `from "generated"` importers (29 top-level + 2 tracked-erc20/ subdir + 2 libs); 86 `.handler(`; 2 `.contractRegister` (sf-vaults + crayons/CrayonsFactory); 6 publishMintEvent callers; verify-belt-config.js + belt-build.yml + EventHandlers.ts all EXIST. L5 vitest is codegen-INDEPENDENT (0 test imports from generated) → stable baseline; L4 createTestIndexer is NET-NEW, not a port.
- Structure: S1 Foundation Batch0 (T0-T4, serial, MEDIUM); S2 Handler port (T5-T11, LARGE — T5-T10 PARALLEL fan-out by family, T11 sf-vaults SOLO/LAST = only contractRegister+Effects+viem); S3 Finalize+Cloud gate (T12 delete EventHandlers + L3/L4/L5, T13 ONLY Cloud round-trip AC-PORT-9, T13.E2E P0). 31 parallel handler leaves marked for /implement fan-out.
- Beads: epics bd-2io(S1/g182) bd-o0g(S2/g183) bd-voi(S3/g184) + 15 tasks. T0=bd-xvl(P0,ready entry). Deps: T1←T0, T2←T1, T3/T4←T0; T5-T10←T2 (labeled `parallel`); T11←T5..T10 (labeled `solo`); T12←T11+T3+T4; T13←T12; T13.E2E←T13 (labeled p0-must-complete). Silent-drift guardrail = T3 coverage bijection + T12 L3 eventConfigs==N + T13 promotion-gate.js expansion-mode parity vs live green + 6-publisher coverage.

## 2026-06-17 (late PM) — Flatline SDD review + DEPLOY-PATH PROBE = GREEN ✅
- **Flatline 3-model SDD review: 16 blockers / 11 high-consensus / 100% agreement** (`grimoires/loa/a2a/flatline/sdd-review.json`). Port MECHANICS sound; gaps are in VERIFICATION + infra/security: (1) **parity methodology broken** — validating 3.2.1-Cloud vs live green (alpha.17) compares two engines → use ON-CHAIN ground-truth + a sample floor; (2) **dynamic-contract bijection hole** — the config↔onEvent coverage check misses `sf-vaults` + `CrayonsFactory` (contractRegister); (3) **probe deploy path BEFORE porting 31** (top rec); (4) key/secret custody to Cloud unresolved (3rd-party-trust); (5) G-A3 pillar flaws (synthetic-only, InMemoryPrevHashStore resets on Cloud restart, NATS backfill DOS, test-subject prefix not enforced→prod-publish risk); (6) billing may start at project-creation not gate-GREEN. NOT yet folded into SDD §2A.
- Operator chose **"probe deploy path first."**
- **PROBE GREEN (the central de-risk):** branch `probe/envio-321-deploypath` (b5a8e66; trigger e392aee1) — minimal config.probe.yaml (Optimism, HoneyJar Transfer) + ONE handler ported to the 3.2.1 `indexer.onEvent`/`from "envio"` API, others excluded via `handlers: src/probe_handlers` glob scoping. Deployed to a separate Cloud instance `thj-indexer-probe` → **at Optimism head, processing batches, ZERO errors, NO crash-loop, NO `Cannot find generated`** (logs 2026-06-17T23-54). **→ The SDD §2A port transform is PROVEN on Cloud. The 31-handler port is de-risked.**
- 3.2.1 handler discovery model = AUTO-GLOB of `handlers:` dir (default `src/handlers`; `evm.schema.json:25`) → un-ported handlers crash-loop unless excluded; `handlers: src/probe_handlers` is the clean scoping lever (also enables incremental porting).
- **REMAINING before full port:** (a) **sf-vaults probe** (DEFERRED — the ONLY contractRegister+Effects+viem-RPC handler, 1189 lines; SKP-003/005 Cloud-RPC + dynamic-registration risk UNPROVEN); (b) **harden SDD §2A** vs the 16 flatline blockers; (c) full 31-handler port (cycle envio-3.2.1-api-port, S182-184).
- Branches on 0xHoneyJar/sonar-api: `canary/envio-cloud-hypersync` (full config, crash-loops on the un-ported handlers — that's expected) · `probe/envio-321-deploypath` (GREEN). Both off public sonar/main.
- PARKED: **KF-016** (new known-failure class — alpha.17→3.2.1 `from "generated"` crash-loop + the onEvent fix; now have evidence, add to known-failures.md). ✅ killed stray `pnpm start` 59956; ✅ operator paused/deleted `sonar-api-3`.

## 2026-06-17 (night) — /compose PORT: FOUNDATION + hardened L3 DONE (banked before the fan-out)
- Operator ran the full port via **/compose** (governed composition runtime, per-tier model routing). Vehicle = **`code-implement-and-review`** — KEY: its emitted segment natively supports a parallel fan-out via `args.items` (wave-scheduled SONNET leaves, worktree-isolatable, opus FAGAN gate) — so "code-implement-and-review-shaped fan-out" was exactly right.
- **FOUNDATION (S182) — valid_run PROVEN.** /compose run `envio321-foundation-01`: 1 segment, converged (FAGAN APPROVED iter 1), terminal gate `compose-verify-run` = **valid_run** (envelope `sha256:9dd428…`, legba chain ✓). Commit **fbd454dd**. Built the safety net: L1–L5 verify loop (`scripts/verify-envio-321.sh`), bijection guardrail (`scripts/check-onevent-bijection.mjs`, SKP-005 dynamic handled), config restructure (dropped per-contract `handler:`, added top-level `handlers: src/handlers`), removed stale `optionalDependencies.generated`. Grounded: `isPreload` IS a real 3.2.1 `BaseHandlerContext` property (the 18 `(context as any)` accesses are valid).
- **L3 hardened — commit 01d97d2c** (`test/registration-coverage.test.ts`): replaced the tautological L3 with a REAL runtime registration check (`vi.mock` envio indexer → spy onEvent/contractRegister → import handlers → assert recorded == config pairs). Catches a present-but-never-fired `onEvent` (the class the static bijection misses). Pre-port full config = **0/83 registered (honest gap)**; probe config passes 1/1. 212 vitest green, codegen exit 0.
- **BRANCH `feat/envio-321-port` — LOCAL ONLY (not pushed), in worktree `/tmp/sonar-canary`.** Branched off `probe/envio-321-deploypath` (so it carries the proven probe handler `src/probe_handlers/honey-jar-probe.ts` + `config.probe.yaml` as the passing L4/registration fixture) which is off `canary/envio-cloud-hypersync` (HyperSync + lazy events + envio@3.2.1 pin+lock + FatBera merge). NOTE: worktree node_modules is now a REAL dir with envio@3.2.1 installed (verification runs locally).
- **RESUME = Run 2: the 31-handler PORT fan-out.** Vehicle: `/compose` code-implement-and-review with `args.items`. Pattern (proven this session): `compose-dispatch.sh <code-implement-and-review.yaml> --form-c --run-id <id> --json` (exit 3, manifest at `~/.loa/constructs/substrates/.run/compose/<id>/`) → `Workflow({scriptPath: <emitted segment>, args: {items:[{id, task:"port <handler> alpha.17→3.2.1: ContractName.Event.handler()/from-generated → indexer.onEvent({contract,event})/from-envio, preserve entity logic", acceptance:"verify-envio-321 L1-L5 + bijection + registration pass for this contract", isolation:"worktree"}, …]}})` → wrap each handoff seed `{construct_slug,persona,output_type,invocation_mode:"room",stage_index,verdict}` via `compose-handoff-wrap.sh` (invocation_mode MUST be room|studio|headless, NOT "fresh") → `compose-verify-run <id> --require-executed --legba` (valid_run). Batch by family (SDD §2A.5, ~6 families); **sf-vaults SOLO/LAST** (only contractRegister+Effects+viem-RPC). Then FINALIZE (delete EventHandlers.ts) + **AC-PORT-9 Cloud re-deploy gate** → 6-chain price/version → ratify bd-buho.
- Cost: foundation run ~325k tokens / 2 agents. Port fan-out est ~1.5–2M.

## 2026-06-18 (S183/S184) — PORT COMPLETE on config.yaml (proven), AC-PORT-9 is the only remaining gate
- **config.yaml port DONE + PROVEN.** All 83 (contract×event) registrations ported alpha.17→3.2.1. Branch `feat/envio-321-port` (base now pushed to origin; 3 new commits LOCAL — see push note). Commits on top of `01d97d2c`:
  - **`e307d7c3`** — 30 handlers + 2 libs (fan-out). /compose run `envio321-port-02` = **valid_run** (8 sonnet/opus leaves + opus FAGAN gate, converged iter 1). Transform: `from "generated"`→`from "envio"`; Contract objects dropped; `indexer` value import; `handlerContext`→`EvmOnEventContext` (7 handlers+2 libs); `.handler()`→`indexer.onEvent({contract,event})`; fatbera `eventFilters`→`where:{params}`. Bodies byte-identical.
  - **`c03f0e74`** — sf-vaults (contractRegister+Effects+viem) + delete obsolete `src/EventHandlers.ts`. /compose run `envio321-sfvaults-01` = **valid_run** (single-context opus path). contractRegister body remap: `anyContext.addSFMultiRewards(x)`→`context.chain.SFMultiRewards.add(x)` (3.2.1 ContractRegistration.add).
  - **`66d8ed5d`** — L3 mock: added `createEffect` stub to `vi.mock("envio")` in `test/registration-coverage.test.ts` so the spy can import the Effects handler (sf-vaults). This was the only blocker to L3 hitting 83/83.
- **verify:321 (config.yaml) = 6 passed / 0 failed / 0 advisory.** L1 codegen 0, L2 tsc 0, **L3 registration 83/83 (all pairs fire at runtime)**, L4 createTestIndexer green, L5 vitest 206 passed, **bijection perfect 83/83 (2 contractRegister, 0 orphans)**. AC-PORT-1..8 met.
- **FIRST FAN-OUT FAILED (recovery learned):** the compose Form-C segment's per-wave stall timer (`STALL_MS`) is a HARD wall-clock cap (fires once at STALL_MS, NOT an inactivity timer), default **90s** — too short for multi-file leaves → all 7 handler families `drain_timeout` while still editing. Abandonment does NOT roll back disk edits (partial/broken files left). FIX: pass **`stall_s: 1200`** in args; reset partial edits via `git restore --source=HEAD` (the destructive-bash-hook-recommended safe form — `git checkout -- <path>` is BLOCKED). Also: **do NOT use `isolation:"worktree"`** for leaves that edit one shared canary via absolute paths (it isolates the wrong branch); disjoint-file concurrent edits are safe.
- **MIBERA BELT — DEFERRED to the Ponder→Envio cutover (operator decision 2026-06-18).** `src/belts/mibera/EventHandlers.mibera.ts` is config.mibera.yaml's curated loader (a re-export aggregator) — broken by the port (imports the dropped `handleX` exports). It is NOT obsolete cruft: it's a live CI-gated separate deployment (belt-build.yml 3 gates, codegen:mibera, tsconfig.mibera.json, verify-belt-config). config.mibera is a clean SUBSET of config.yaml. Operator: "once we cut Ponder, all remnants are cleared" → leave untouched; harmless to config.yaml (scoped tsconfig excludes it). The mibera handler MODULES (in src/handlers/) ARE ported.
- **TOPOLOGY (clears the confusion):** 3 indexers — Envio-classic (dead/frozen), **sovereign-Ponder (`ponder.config.ts`, GREEN = current prod)**, **managed-Envio (`config.yaml`@3.2.1, just ported = TARGET)**. This session was an envio API-version port (alpha.17→3.2.1), NOT a system migration. Per ADR 2026-06-16: move Layer-1 Ponder→managed-Envio to shed Railway toil, but gated on `bd-buho` (1 real billing cycle). This session = the prerequisite; the cutover is future/evidence-gated.
- **RESUME = AC-PORT-9 (operator-driven, the ONLY Cloud round-trip).** Push the 3 commits to origin → operator points an Envio Cloud instance at `feat/envio-321-port` (full `config.yaml`) → confirm it gets PAST the crash-loop + syncs the 6 chains (1, 10, 8453, 42161, 7777777, 80094). FR-4 parity vs live green via promotion-gate.js expansion-mode (open: parity-vs-on-chain-ground-truth, NOT vs alpha.17 green — flatline SKP-002/012). → unblocks managed deploy → 6-chain price/version → `bd-buho` ratify. Beads closed: bd-o0g, bd-5hq, bd-un9. Open tail: bd-4t2c (Cloud gate), bd-lst9 (E2E), bd-voi (S184 epic).

## 2026-06-23 — Session synthesis (⚠ SUPERSEDES the AC-PORT-9 resume pointer directly above)

**The "AC-PORT-9 / Cloud" pointer above is RETIRED.** Operator confirmed sonar runs on **Railway, not managed Envio Cloud**. The managed-Cloud cutover cluster (bd-4t2c / bd-lst9 / bd-voi / bd-7l7.1 / bd-7l7.5 + epic bd-2io) is **CLOSED as superseded**. KF-015 OOM is already solved on Railway (`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size` service var) — not a Cloud lever.

**Shipped:**
- **PR #75 MERGED** (`9cf7152f`) — envio 3.2.1 port; a BB-equiv review caught + I fixed a real FatBera-deposit-window regression (H1) + verify-tsconfig gap (H2). verify:321 6/6, bijection 83/83.
- **PR #76 OPEN** — Pythenians ($PTN) NFT-collection ownership SVM pipe (Helius DAS getAssetsByGroup, run-marker reconcile, two wipe guards). Hardened after an adversarial review caught a committed `node_modules` symlink + 8 issues. Branch `feat/svm-pythians-holders` → `feat/envio-cloud-hypersync`.
- Bead reconciliation committed: sonar `7860cf28` (17 closes), loa-finn `8d686d82` (bd-bqek dune-meter-merge + bd-ijnh retract).

**Verified MVP truth (corrects my own earlier over-claims this session):**
- The **Shadow-Mode MVP is BUILT** — loa-freeside **#296** (`shadow-access-audit`): `packages/protocol/shadow-audit` + `adapters/sonar` (Transfer-replay, reorg-safe) + `services/shadow-audit` + SDD (`loa-freeside/grimoires/loa/sdd.md`). NOT a gap.
- **Sonar's role = serve the `Transfer` stream** the loa-freeside `adapters/sonar` adapter folds (`belt-gateway-production/v1/graphql`). **MET.** No sonar audit-layer work needed (I retracted a redundant spec + bead).
- Remaining: dune-meter merge (loa-freeside `feat/dune-meter-cost-adapter` `8b8c0142` — fixed, unmerged; loa-finn Corpus-Engine next cycle, NOT the audit) · control-plane wiring (coexistence adapter built-not-wired, deferred post-validation) · external-audit on-demand indexing (deferred SKU). Arrakis = external context only, `decisionEligible:false` at MVP.

**Recall discipline (meta-lesson):** `/recall` (QMD) is healthy (~11.7k files); use the DEFAULT `query` mode — **never `--mode search`** on conceptual intents (returns 0; caused 3 over-assertions this session). Pruned the phantom `construct-observer` collection + stamped 22 grimoire artifacts → `recall-doctor` verdict now **HONEST**.

**RESUME (grounded):** Shadow-Mode audit MVP is shipped; sonar has no MVP-blocking work (PR #76 is review-ready). Next high-leverage is operator-gated: (a) loa-finn re-point (Corpus Engine = the product; close drift sprints — needs per-sprint grounding) + the dune-meter merge; (b) the 29 orphan QMD collections (governance-declaration reconciliation, doctor coverage warning).
