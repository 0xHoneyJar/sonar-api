# PreToolUse:Write Adversarial Review Gate
# =============================================================================
# Blocks Write tool calls targeting */COMPLETED when flatline_protocol is
# enabled in .loa.config.yaml but the corresponding adversarial-*.json
# artefact is missing — or present but structurally invalid — in the
# sprint directory.
#
# Catches the class of bug where reviewing-code / auditing-security skills
# execute inline and silently skip Phase 2.5 (cross-model adversarial review).
#
# Structural validation (raises bypass cost beyond `touch artefact.json`):
#   Artefact must parse as JSON and contain .metadata.type and .metadata.model.
#   Both fields are written by .claude/scripts/adversarial-review.sh on every
#   code path (success, api_failure, malformed_response, clean, and
#   skipped_by_config), so any legitimate review run satisfies the gate.
#   A bare `touch artefact.json` or empty-object write does not.
#
# Fail-open on parse error, missing yq, or malformed config (infrastructure
# faults must not block legitimate work). Fail-CLOSED when .loa.config.yaml
# cannot be resolved at all — an unresolvable config means we can't evaluate
# enforcement and silent-skip is exactly what this gate exists to block.
# Opt-out via LOA_ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_ENFORCE=false.
# Test override: LOA_CONFIG_PATH_OVERRIDE.
#
# Contract (hook):
#   stdin  = {tool_name, tool_input: {file_path, ...}}
#   exit 0 = allow (also emitted for unparseable input or non-Write calls)
#   exit 2 = block (with message on stderr) — Claude Code blocks PreToolUse
#            on exit 2 only; exit 2 is a non-blocking hook error (bug-1002)
#
# perf pass-2 (2026-07-05, skill-loop): fork/exec reduction. stdin is read
# with the read builtin (was a cat spawn); the unparseable-payload fallback
# probe uses a bash substring test (`grep -q '/COMPLETED'` has no regex
# metachars or anchors, and substring-in-some-line ≡ substring-in-string,
# so [[ == *…* ]] is byte-equivalent); dirname spawns (1 + up to 6 in the
# config walk) are parameter expansions with the POSIX dirname edge cases
# preserved (see inline notes). jq/yq calls are untouched (pass-3 scope).
# =============================================================================

# No `set -euo pipefail` — this hook must never fail closed. A jq or yq
# failure, a missing config file, a malformed path all must allow the write.

# Trust model note (audit, bug-1002 wave): the artifact check accepts any
# JSON with .metadata.type/.model — FORGEABLE by an actor who can already
# write the sprint directory. Accepted class: this is a mistake-fence
# against skipping Phase 2.5, not a security boundary; the writer and the
# gated agent share a trust domain (same accepted-bypass posture as
# block-destructive-bash.sh — see hooks-reference.md).

# Opt-out first (cheapest check)

# Audit iter (bug-1002): the old 64 KiB head-cap truncated large Write
# payloads MID-JSON, jq failed, and the `|| exit 0` fail-open meant any
# */COMPLETED write over 64 KiB bypassed the gate. Read the full payload
# (bounded by the tool-call size) and parse once; on a parse failure,
# fail CLOSED only when the raw payload visibly targets a COMPLETED
# marker — everything else stays fail-open (this is a mistake-fence).
# perf pass-2: read builtin instead of $(cat) — same bytes modulo the
# trailing newline (irrelevant to jq and to the substring probe). A payload
# containing a NUL byte would truncate at the NUL instead of dropping NULs;
# JSON cannot carry raw NUL, and either shape fails the jq parse into the
# same fallback path.
